The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.\nOn January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.\nIn times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.\nHowever, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!\nBy the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.\nBut this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken. So the next time you are in a supermarket maybe check the ingredients of your food before you buy it or you could get a nasty surprise ...", "id": "high4343.txt", "specific_questions": ["What is the scandal?", "Which statement isn't among the reasons why customers are furious?", "What didn't Tesco do in response to the scandal?"], "cloze_questions": [], "general_questions": []}, "gqt_qgg": ["What supermarket chain was involved in the horsemeat scandal in Great Britain?", "When did food inspectors discover horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers?", "How much horsemeat was found in the beefburgers sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland?", "How did Tesco respond to the discovery of horsemeat in their beefburgers?", "Why did the news of the horsemeat scandal spread quickly in the age of social media?", "What did Tesco promise to do in order to prevent such incidents in the future?", "Why might British people be particularly shocked by the idea of eating horsemeat?", "What reasons do customers have for wanting to ensure that the products they buy accurately reflect their contents?", "What suggestions does the article make for avoiding similar food scandals in the future?", "What advice does the article give to consumers regarding checking food labels in supermarkets?"]}, {"data": {"answers": ["A", "C", "C", "B", "A"], "options": [["They prefer higher education competition.", "They try to gain advantage in market share.", "They want to project their image.", "They hope to make some changes."], ["the brand", "the college name", "the concept of marketing", "list of majors"], ["catch up with", "deal with", "put forward", "come to the realization"], ["is observed by the society", "hopes to expand its influence", "prefers to inform its teaching programs", "expects to enlarge its campus"], ["turned out very successful", "failed to attain its goal", "got rid of some jokes", "transformed its status"]], "questions": ["Which of the following is NOT the reason for colleges to change their names?", "It is implied that one of the most significant changes in higher education in the past decade is   _  .", "The phrase \"come up with\" (Line 3, Para. 4) probably means   _  .", "The case of name changing from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State,East Bay indicates that the university   _  .", "According to the officials, the name change of BeaverCollege  _  ."], "article": "Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education.

But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has  _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"theNewSchool\".\n    Changes in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east ofSan Francisco.\n    Beaver College turned itself intoArcadiaUniversityin 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and \"morning zoo\" radio shows.\nMany college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results.

It gained the empire but, without its trees, its soil became hard and poor. When the empire fell to pieces, the country found itself faced by floods and starvation.\nEven though a government realizes the importance of a plentiful supply of trees, it is difficult for it to persuade the villager to see this. The villager wants wood to cook his food with, and he can earn money by making charcoal  or selling wood to the townsman . He is usually too lazy or too careless to plant and look after trees. So unless the government has a good system of control, or can educate the people, the forests will slowly disappear.\nThis does not only mean that the villager's sons and grandsons have fewer trees. The results are even more serious. For where there are trees their roots break the soil up--allowing the rain to sink in and also hold the soil, thus preventing it being washed away easily, but where there are no trees, the soil becomes hard and poor. The rain falls on hard ground and flows away on the surface, causing floods and carrying away with it the rich topsoil, in which crops grow so well.

Another one Chivers mentions is from Star Wars, where glowing beams of light traveling through space look very impressive. The problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd not be seen, which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.\nChivers' second piece of Star Wars nonsense is the sound the fighters make in the movies: \" the bellow  of an elephant mixed with a car driving on a wet road\". But sound needs a medium to travel through, like air. In space, there wouldn't actually be any sound at all.\nFew people would deny that the mind-bending Matrix films make for great viewing, but for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little silly.\nAnd finally: as Chivers points out, DAN is not replaceable.

Many theories,even some mystical ones,have been advanced to explain the popularity of jogging. The plain truth is that jogging is a cheap,quick and efficient way to maintain (or achieve) physical fitness.\nThe most useful sort of exercise is exercise that develops the heart,lungs, and circulatory systems. If these systems are fit,the body is ready for almost any sport and for almost any sudden demand made by work or emergencies. One can train more specifically,as by developing strength for weight lifting or the ability to run straight ahead for short distances with great power as in football,but running trains your heart and lungs to deliver oxygen more efficiently to all parts of your body. It is worth doing that: this sort of exercise is the only kind that can reduce heart disease, the number one cause of death in America.\nOnly one sort of equipment is needed--a pair of good shoes. Physicians advise beginning joggers not to try to run in tennis or gym shoes. Many design advances have been made in only the last several years that make a pair of excellent running shoes indispensable if a runner wishes to develop as quickly as possible,with as little chance of injury as possible. A pair of good running shoes will have soft pads for absorbing shock, as well as slightly built-up heels and full heel cups that will give the knee and ankle more stability. A wise investment in good shoes will prevent blisters and the foot,ankle and knee injuries and will also enable the wearer to run on paved or soft surfaces. No other special equipment is needed; you can jog in any clothing you desire,even your street clothes.\nIt takes surprisingly little time to develop the ability to run. The American Jogging Association has a twelve-week program designed to move from a fifteen- minute walk (which almost anyone can manage who is in reasonable health) to a thirty-minute run.

So, it's normally a very lively place. And it was total silence there; and it was a very, very strange feeling in the whole small village. And it's totally impossible to grasp what is going on. And then it just kept on. It's still almost impossible to understand it. It's also one of the reasons why it's so important with memorials for these kind of things.

Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since 1719, when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n     Near the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support.\nDefoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged  a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality.

They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly and abundantly, or to live dully and meanly. A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: \"I think, therefore I am.\"\nBut the best definition of existence I ever saw was one written by another philosopher who said: \"To be is to be in relations.\" If this is true, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity  of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But other than our regular occupation, how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concerned --- poetry and prose , music, pictures, sports, unselfish friendships, politics, international affairs ---you are dead.\nOn the contrary, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest --- even more, a new accomplishment  --- you increase your power of life. No one who is deeply interested in different kinds of subjects can remain unhappy. The real _ is the person who has lost interest.\nBacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts with new friends, and new ideas and thoughts, too. Where your thoughts are, there will be your life too. If your thoughts are limited only to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to your narrow circle of the town in which you live, then you live a narrow restricted(, ) life. But if you are interested in what is going on in China, then you are living in China. If you're interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people. If you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.\nTo be or not to be --- to live intensely and richly, or merely to exist, which depends on ourselves.

Lomax recorded many of Woody's songs for the Library of Congress. \n         Three years later, Woody published a book called Bound for Glory. It was about his early life and travels.

Eventually, innovators   even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered.

Her great contributions are in three areas.\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity   shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\nHer second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian   tunes, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\nHer third contribution was in the use of music.

There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can't foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we? Weather forecasting is wide open for scientists who love to solve puzzling problems. The next generation of meteorologists (weather scientists) will unlock many of Earth's weather secrets.

When you make eye contact, you are giving a confident image.\n*Always introduce a person of lesser authority to one of greater authority. The most important thing to remember is to say the most important person's name first.\nFor example, when introducing your supervisor to a job candidate  , you would give your supervisor's name first. \"Bob Jones, may I introduce Susan Lee, who has just graduated from ABC University?\"\n*In a situation where rank is unimportant, an introduction is based on sex and age. A man is presented to a woman and a younger woman to an older woman.\nWhat if you find yourself in a situation where you have forgotten the other person's name? Start with a handshake and reintroduce   yourself. When doing this, you will usually cause the other person to do the same.\nHowever, if the other person does not take your suggestion, it is OK simply to apologize and let the person know that you cannot remember her or his name.

So he set up a small desk, put up the \"an available academic is sitting here\" sign and asked the unemployed to just sit in the windows like goods. It seems like a pretty desperate measure, but at least it works. According to the agency's website, three of the jobseekers in their window display got a job in a day or two.\nPeitersen says he came up with the idea after realizing human resource managers get hundreds of job applications every day, which look more or less the same, and that creative thinking is required in order to increase the chances of finding employment.

Tobacco plants produce nicotine because it defends against insects that would otherwise eat the plants.\n              The butts are undoubtedly smelly. But birds are actually quite fond of smelly chemicals, such as those found in aromatic   plants. Some nest-building species regularly fill their nests with fresh aromatics, possibly because the chemicals are good for the immune system or the development of the chicks. Alternatively, the plant chemicals might act as insecticides.\n              In the study, researchers at the Autonomous University of Tlaxcala in Mexico set up heat traps, which attract harmful insects, in 55 nests around Mexico City. Some traps were lined with the stuff in smoked cigarette filters. The others were lined with the stuff from unsmoked cigarette filters, which did not contain nicotine and other smoking by-products.

Westerners often make mistakes at the table in China or in a Chinese home. In order not to have an embarrassing  experience, here are some things to consider next time you are eating with some Chinese.\nStep1:\nKeep in mind that food is shared. It is one of the biggest differences between Chinese and Western eating habits. In China a few dishes are placed in the center of a table and shared by all. Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate. Refusing it would not be polite even if you are full.\nStep2:\nRespect the chopsticks. The chopsticks are the single most important tool at a Chinese table. Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.\nStep3:\nUse communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.\nStep4:\nRespect the elders. Table manners in China place extra respect on elders. At the table, pass food to your elders before taking it for yourself. If someone makes a toast, make sure that when you clink glasses with someone older than you, the rim of your glass is lower than the rim of the elder person.", "id": "high3046.txt", "specific_questions": [], "cloze_questions": ["According to the passage, the following are wrong EXCEPT that   _  ."], "general_questions": ["How can you use your chopsticks according to the passage?", "What is the purpose of writing the passage?"]}, "gqt_qgg": ["What are some noticeable differences in table manners between Western and Chinese cultures?", "How is food typically shared at a Chinese table?", "Why is it important to offer thanks when a Chinese host places food on your plate?", "Why should you not skewer food with chopsticks at a Chinese table?", "Where should you place your chopsticks when not in use at a Chinese table?", "What are communal chopsticks used for at a Chinese table?", "Why is it important to respect elders at the table in Chinese culture?", "What should you do when making a toast with someone older than you at a Chinese table?", "How can Westerners avoid embarrassing experiences at the table in China?"]}, {"data": {"answers": ["C", "B", "C", "B"], "options": [["surprised", "relaxed", "worried", "excited"], ["had breakfast", "went to bed", "took exercise", "rode to school"], ["proud of him", "tired of him", "strict with him", "pleased with him"], ["could read Serbian", "didn't cheat at last", "got a good grade at last", "didn't work hard that night"]], "questions": ["The writer might feel   _   before the Math Test.", "Which is the best expression to fill in the blank   in the passage?", "The writer's father was   _  .", "From the passage, we know that the writer   _  ."], "article": "One day in the eighth grade, I was taking a Math Test on basic trigonometry  .

It is important to start by helping your students recognize sounds before you expect them to produce them.\nSpoken British English has 44 sounds, but there are only 26 letters in the alphabet for written English. This sometimes makes English pronunciation and spelling different, so it is not always best to write words on the blackboard at the early stages. Also, some sounds in English do not exist in some other languages. This can make it very difficult for students to recognize these sounds and even more difficult for them to pronounce them correctly. So some students need to do a lot of work on these sounds, listening to them, trying to recognize them and trying to copy them.\nIf you can understand and pronounce the symbols of the phonetic alphabet, this will help you to pronounce any word in the dictionary. You can teach this phonetic alphabet to your students and this will make teaching pronunciation much easier. However, you can teach pronunciation effectively without knowing the phonetic alphabet. Pronouncing English well is not just about getting the individual sounds right. Students need to know:\n* which parts of a word are stressed (spoken louder and longer);\n* which parts of a sentence are stressed;\n* basic intonation patterns;\n* what it means when we change the intonation in a sentence (the music of the language);\n* how to link together the sounds within a sentence.\nStudents need practice in all these areas to improve their pronunciation.", "id": "high21747.txt", "specific_questions": [], "cloze_questions": ["In the author's opinion,   _  .", "Following up the passage, the author will probably   _  .", "The passage is most probably from   _  ."], "general_questions": ["Which of the following is the best title for the passage?"]}, "gqt_qgg": ["How many sounds are there in Spoken British English?", "Why is it sometimes not best to write words on the blackboard at the early stages of learning English pronunciation?", "What can make it difficult for students to recognize and pronounce certain sounds in English?", "How can understanding the symbols of the phonetic alphabet help with pronunciation?", "What are some key aspects of pronunciation that students need to learn besides individual sounds?", "What are some areas students need practice in to improve their pronunciation?", "Why is it important to help students recognize sounds before expecting them to produce them?", "How many letters are there in the English alphabet for written English?", "Can pronunciation be effectively taught without using the phonetic alphabet?", "What does it mean when we change the intonation in a sentence in English?"]}, {"data": {"answers": ["A", "D", "B"], "options": [["They don't know what her family is really like.", "They have a different culture.", "They aren't strict with their children.", "They don't have a good sense of humor."], ["a robot kid", "a kid with no play dates", "a kid uninterested in the piano", "an independent thinker"], ["Sophia is thankful for what her strict mother has made her", "Sophia has never been disturbed by tea parties.", "Sophia is satisfied with her parents' way of raising her.", "Tiger Mom was blamed for rejecting her daughters' birthday cards."]], "questions": ["In the writer's opinion, why do some people criticize her mother", "The passage tells us her mother's strict parenting raised the writer to be   _  .", "Which of the following sentences is Wrong"], "article": "Tiger Mom,\nYou've been criticized  a lot since your book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, came out.

Streas, however, is a very normal part of life.\nIt is important to understand that stress doesn't come from an event itself, that is, from the things that are happening in our lives. It comes from the meaning we give to what has happened. For example, a crying baby may be stressful to one person, but it may not bother another person at all, a traffic jam may be stressful to one person while another person may be able to stay calm.\nWe can experience stress any time we feel we don't have control. It can come from a feeling that we can't do anything about a situation. Basically, it is the body's way of showing anxiety or worry.\nStress is not just caused by our mental or emotional condition. It is also influenced by how tired we are, whether we have a balanced diet with enough vitamins and minerals, whether we get enough physical exercise, and whether we can relax.\nThe key point of relieving the stress is that we need to find what is causing the stress in our lives.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for his achievements. There are four basic types of blood in the ABO system: A, B, AB and O. Everybody is born with one of these four types of blood. We get blood type, just like hair color and height from parents. Because of the substances  contained in each type, the four groups must be _ carefully, If two different blood types are mixed together, it may put a person into an extremely dangerous situation. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. In an emergency, type O blood can be given because it is most likely to be accepted by all blood types, so it is often called the universal donor. However, there is still a risk. For the opposite reason, AB is sometimes called the universal receiver. However, because there can be so many reactions in the blood bank of the hospital.\nThere is a relationship between your blood type and your nationality.

The job responsibilities requested occasional visits to the classroom of each teacher in the program. Dorothy stands out in my memory as one who \"bloomed\" in her remote area.\n              Dorothy taught in a school In Harlan County, Kentucky, Appalachian Mountain area. To get to her school from the town of Harlan, I followed a road winding around the mountain. In the eight-mile journey, I crossed the same railroad track five times, giving the possibility of getting caught by the same train five times. Rather than feeling excited by this drive through the mountains, I found it depressing. The poverty level was shocking and the small shabby  houses gave me the greatest feeling of hopelessness.\n              From the moment of my arrival at the little school, all gloom   disappeared. Upon arriving at Dorothy's classroom. I was greeted with smiling faces and treated like a queen. The children had been prepared to show me their latest projects. Dorothy told me with a big smile that they were serving poke greens salad and cornbread for \"dinner\" (lunch). In case you don't know, poke greens are a weed-type plant that grows wild, especially on poor ground.\n              Dorothy never ran out of reports of exciting activities of her students. Her enthusiasm  never cooled down. When it came time to sit for the testing and interviewing required to receive her Child Development Associate Certification, Dorothy was ready. She came to the assessment and passed in all areas. Afterward, she invited me to the one-and-only steak house in the area to celebrate her victory, as if she had received her Ph. D. degree. After the meal, she placed a little box containing  an old pen in my hand. She said it was a family heirloom  , but to me it is a treasured symbol of appreciation and pride that cannot be matched with things.

But this meaning does not tell us very much. Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.\nTwo broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.\nOf what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.\nThere are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job.

handkerchief tied in a knot behind his little nine-year-old head, he looked like a pirate, a sad pirate. The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. He was also very angry.\nPaul Newman's camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears. After the hug and kiss, he put his hands on my shoulders, and tears still in his eyes, said: \"See you on the other side of the door, Fatha.\"", "id": "high20926.txt", "specific_questions": ["What do you think the theme of the story is?"], "cloze_questions": ["Seeing David smashing the potato chips, the counselor did the same thing in response because he  _  .", "The camp counselors failed to fill David's beginning days with fun and laughter, mainly because David  _  ."], "general_questions": ["What can we learn from this article?", "Which of the following does NOT show the change in David?"]}, "gqt_qgg": ["What was the initial reaction of the camp counselors towards David when he first arrived at the camp?", "How did David's behavior change during the camp session?", "What event at the camp is described as \"huge\" in the article?", "How did David release his anger during cabin night?", "What role did the college-age counselor play in helping David during the camp session?", "What conversation did the author have with David during Mass in the woods?", "How did David say goodbye to the author and the counselors at the camp?", "What tradition takes place at the camp talent show?", "Why did David have to leave the camp early and go to the hospital?", "How did David express his feelings towards the author before leaving the camp?"]}, {"data": {"answers": ["B", "A", "C", "A", "C"], "options": [["plants", "fruit trees", "ants", "crops"], ["selling his vegetables , fruit and flowers", "growing trees in his garden", "working in the market", "helping other people growing plants"], ["he has a good garden", "he is good at growing things and likes listening to the radio", "music helps his plants a lot", "he is very hardworking"], ["Matt' s garden is better than theirs", "Matt works harder than they", "Matt knows how to grow vegetables well", "the radio helps Matt to grow veveything well in his garden"], ["he doesn' t give thim any vegetables or fruit", "he listens to the radio too much", "they are jealous  of him", "Matt doesn' t let them listen to his radio"]], "questions": ["There are not only vegetables and flowers , but also    _    in Matt' s garden .", "Matt makes a living by    _   .", "Everything in Matt' s garden grows well because    _", "People think that    _    .", "People don' t like Matt because    _   ."], "article": "Matt grow the best vegetables in the village.He grows fruit too--big , sweet apples and oranges.And what else ?

My marks in school were miserable and, the thing was, I didn't know enough to really care. My older bother and I lived with Mom in an ugly multi-family house in Detroit. We watched TV every night. The background noise of our lives was gunfire and horses'  hoofs  from \"Wagon Train\" or \"Cheyenne\", and laughter from\"I Love Lucy\", or\"Mister Ed\".After supper, we'd lie on Mom's bed and stare for hours at the TV screen.\nBut one day Mom changed our world forever. She turned off the TV. Our mother had only been able to get through third grade. But, she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time. She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books. So she came home one day, switched off the TV, sat us down and explained that her sons were going to make something of themselves. \"You boys are going to read two books every week,\" she said. \"And you're going to write a report on what you read.\"\nWe moaned(,) and complained about how unfair it was. Besides, we didn't have any books in the house other than Mom's Bible. But she explained that we would go where the books were: \"I'll drive you to the library.\"\nSo pretty soon there were these two peevish boys sitting in her white 1959 Oldsmobile on their way to Detroit Public Library. I wandered reluctantly  among the children's books. I loved animals, so when I saw some books that seemed to be about animals, I started leafing through them.\nThe first book I read clear through wasChip the Dam Builder. It was about beavers . For the first time in my life I was lost in another world. No television program had ever taken me so far away from my surroundings as did this virtue visit to a cold stream in a forest and these animals building a home.\nIt didn't dawn on me at the time, but the experience was quite different from watching TV. There were images forming in my mind instead of before my eyes. And I could return to them again and again with the flip of a page.\nSoon I began to look forward to visiting this quiet sanctuary form my other world. I moved from animals to plants, and then to rocks. Between the covers of all those books were whole worlds, and I was free to go anywhere in them. Along the way a funny thing happened: I started to know things. Teachers started to notice it too. I got to the point where I couldn't wait to get home to my books.\nNow my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. Sometimes I still can't believe my life's journey, from a failing and indifferent student in a Detroit public school to this position, which takes me all over the world to teach and perform critical surgery.\nBut I know when the journey began the day Mom switched off the TV set and put us in her Oldsmobile for that drive to the library.", "id": "high1006.txt", "specific_questions": ["How did the two boys feel about going to the library at first?"], "cloze_questions": ["We can learn from the beginning of the passage that   _  .", "The author began to love books for the following reasons EXCEPT that   _  ."], "general_questions": ["Which of the following is not true about the author's family?"]}, "gqt_qgg": ["In what year did the narrator's mother make a life-changing decision to turn off the TV?", "What was the first book that the narrator read clear through thanks to his mother's encouragement?", "How did the narrator's experience of reading books differ from watching television?", "What was it that the narrator began to look forward to after visiting the library?", "What is the narrator's occupation now that he has grown up?", "What kind of books did the narrator start with, and how did his interests change over time?", "How did the narrator's teachers start to notice a change in him after he began reading more?", "What role did the narrator's older brother play in their mother's decision to start going to the library regularly?", "In what city did the narrator grow up before moving to Baltimore?", "How did the narrator's mother instill a love of reading in her sons?"]}, {"data": {"answers": ["D", "A", "C", "B", "A"], "options": [["ginger", "pepper", "garlic", "pearls"], ["The Chinese have eaten medicinal food for a long time.", "Many Chinese believe medicinal food tastes good.", "Medicinal food may be bad for your health.", "Medicinal food is served all over the world."], ["Because it gave food different flavors.", "Because it made food more delicious.", "Because it was good for people's health.", "Because it made people feel cold."], ["When did the Chinese start to eat bird brains?", "Why do women like \"Queen's Secret\"?", "What is the advantage of using pepper?", "How do Chinese people stop a toothache?"], ["More foreigners will learn more about medicinal food.", "All the Chinese will believe black rice stops hair turning gray.", "Ginger will be more and more popular in China.", "Medicinal food will be sold in drugstores and supermarkets."]], "questions": ["All of the followings are common spices in Chinese cooking EXCEPT  _  .", "What do you know about medicinal food?", "Why did the Chinese begin to use ginger many years ago?", "Which answer to the following questions can be found out from the passage?", "What can we infer   according to the passage?"], "article": "Do you have a headache?

They used ginger because it was medicinal. Ginger, they thought, was good for the digestion. It also helped people who had colds. Pepper and garlic, too, were probably medicines a long time ago.\nSome people don't believe that food and spices are good medicines. They want to buy their medicine in drugstores, not in supermarkets. Other people want to try medicinal food. They say, \"Maybe medicinal food can't help me.

In 1852,for instance,a girl sat for her Daguerrotype,her head slightly turned,giving the camera an unsmiling look. She is preserved forever as a very serious girl indeed. Charles Darwin,a loving and playful parent,looks frozen in photographs. Why did our ancestors,from unknown sitters for family portraits  to the great and famous,because so sad in front of the camera?\nThe severity is everywhere in Victorian photographs. However,you don't have to look very long at these unsmiling old photos to see how incomplete the seemingly obvious answer is-that they are freezing their faces in order to keep still for the long exposure times. In Julia Margaret Cameron's Portrait of Tennyson,the poet dreams,his face a shadowed mask of genius. This is not simply a technique. It's an emotional choice.\nPeople in the past did not go around in a continual state of sorrow. In fact,the Victorians had a sense of humor even about the darkest aspects of their society. Laughter was not just common in the past but accepted by society far more than it is today,from medieval carnivals  to Georgian print shops,where people gathered to look at the latest funnies. Far from preventing festivals and fun,the Victorians,who invented photography,also created Christmas as a celebration as it is today. So the severity of people in the 19th-century photographs cannot be the evidence of generalized sadness. This was not a society in permanent desperation. Instead,the true answer has to do with attitudes to portraiture itself.\nPeople who sat for early photographs understood it as a significant moment. Sitting for the camera was cheaper,quicker and meant that people who never had a chance to be painted could now be photographed; but people seemed to have taken it seriously in the same way they would be a painted portrait. Like a portrait painting,it was intended as a timeless record of a person.\nTo me those unsmiling people probably had as much fun as we do,if not more.

If laughter exercises the body, it must be beneficial.\nOther tests have shown that laughter appears to be able to reduce the effect of pain on the body. In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programs. The group that tolerated  the pain for the longest time was the groups which listened to a funny program. The reason why laughter can reduce pain seems to be that it helps to produce a kind of chemicals in the brain which _ both stress and pain.\nAs a result of these discoveries, some doctors in the United States now hold laughter clinics, in which they help to improve their patients' condition by encouraging them to laugh. They have found that even if their patients do not really feel like laughing, making them smile is enough to produce beneficial effects similar to those who are caused by laughter.", "id": "high22472.txt", "specific_questions": [], "cloze_questions": ["The main idea of the passage is   _  .", "Doctors hold laughter clinics   _  ."], "general_questions": []}, "gqt_qgg": ["What is the English saying related to laughter and health?", "How have doctors recently started looking into the effects of laughter on the human body?", "What were the results of tests studying the effects of laughter on the body?", "How do laughter exercises affect the body?", "In what way can laughter reduce the effect of pain on the body?", "What kind of clinics do some doctors in the United States hold to improve their patients' condition?", "What is one of the key chemicals produced in the brain when laughter helps to reduce stress and pain?", "What type of programs did the group that tolerated pain the longest listen to in the experiment?", "What specific effects does laughter have on the body according to the article?", "What similar benefits can smiling produce even if a person does not actually laugh?"]}, {"data": {"answers": ["B", "C", "C", "C"], "options": [["He is really a good philosopher.", "He can get on well with others.", "He told the writer to reveal her true opinions.", "The passage doesn't mention it."], ["She likes the song very much.", "The singer is one of her friends.", "The song expresses her feelings.", "She uses it to perfects her article."], ["She is now living abroad but doesn't enjoy the life there.", "She sometimes doubts her father's philosophy.", "She shows a positive attitude to her relationship with others.", "She doesn't think highly of her friends by saying \"They are good\"."], ["happy", "homesick", "lonely", "alone"]], "questions": ["What do we know about the writer's father according to this passage?", "Why does the writer mention the song twice in the passage?", "Which of the following statements about the writer is not TRUE?", "The writer mostly expresses that she feels   _   in this passage."], "article": "My father always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people unless such opinions are positive.

Already there have been more than enough teachers, engineers, physicists, aerospace experts, and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren't there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree.\nOn the other hand, there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can deal with, and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old gap that white --collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true. The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen.\nThe reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree. Parents begin indoctrinating  their children with this myth before they are out of grade school. High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college, so of course they must go. And every year college enrollments  go up and up, and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them.\nOne result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ .

A striking example is provided by Dr. Otto Loewi, a pharmacologist and winner of a Nobel Prize. Loewi had spent years studying the chemical transmission  of nerve impulses  . A major breakthrough in his research came when he dreamed of an experiment three nights in a row. On the first two nights he woke up and wrote down the experiment quickly and untidily on paper. But the next morning, he couldn't tell what the notes meant. On the third night, he got up after having the dream. This time, instead of making notes he went straight to his laboratory and performed the important experiment. Loewi later said that if the experiment had occurred to him while awake he would not have given it another thought.\nLoewi's experiment gives some insight into using dreams to produce creative solutions. Nervous feelings are reduced during dreaming, which may be especially useful in solving problems that require a fresh point of view.\n Being able to take advantage of dreams for solving is improved if you \"set\" yourself before sleeping. Before you go to bed, try to think intently about a problem you wish to solve. Bury yourself in the problem by stating it clearly and reviewing all relevant information. Then use the suggestions listed in the previous section to catch your dreams. Although this method is not guaranteed to produce an original solution or a new insight, it is certain to be an adventure.

World War II when she became a ferry pilot for the Women Airforce Service Pilots.After that she turned a flight instructor in 1945.She even wrote her own book named Girls Can't Be Pilots.She passed away on 28 July,2008,after flying for 40,000 hours in the air.\nHannah Szenes was born on 17th July,1921 and was trained to parachute  by the British army into Yugoslavia during World War II.This task was given in order to save the Jews of Hungary.Her secret mission was not revealed even when she was tortured  following her arrest at the Hungarian border.Hannah Szenes had to brave immense

the slogan around colleges was \"Save water. Shower with a friend.\" Now, Wuhan University has come up with another system for the campus bathhouse. It charges students for the amount of time in a shower. Before entering the bathhouse, students pay for the amount of time they want in the shower with cash or their student ID card. The clock starts ticking the minute the tape is turned on. It pauses when a button is pressed for soap. An integrated circuit (IC) card reader at each tap shows the time. No money, no water. The benefits of the new system can be seen with the old system, which charged 1 Yuan for each person regardless of time in the shower. The university used about 320 tons of water daily under the old system, but only 160 tons now.\nMany students use the new system but opinions on it are divided. Some students say it is bad because bathing had become a sort of race. Many people using it for the first time are not sure how long they need to shower. Some might be embarrassed if their time is up and they're still covered in soap. They have to ask the bathhouse worker to help them buy extra time.\n\"It's a _ in the system that you can not buy extra time on the ID card,\" said Ren, a freshman in Wuhan University. The university is also considering some students' suggestions that they be allowed to pay after they've finished the shower. Not surprisingly, some are complaining about losing the hour shower. But many students say the move helps them develop a water-saving sense.\nWithout the time limits, most students tended to shower for 30 to an hour in the bathhouse.\nSome even used the hot water to wash their clothes. \"In my experience, 10--20 minutes is enough,\" said Dai Zhihua, a third-year student who usually takes 8 minutes.\nA similar system has been installed in other universities.

A good deal depends, of course, on the meaning of \"future\". If one is thinking in terms of science fiction and the space age, it is at least possible to assume that man will have solved such trivial and earthly problems as housing. Writers of science fiction, from H.G. Wells onwards, have had little to say on the subject. They have conveyed the suggestion that men will live in great comfort, with every imaginable apparatus  to make life smooth, healthy and easy, if not happy. But they have not said what his house will be made of. Perhaps some new building material, as yet unimagined, will have been discovered or invented at least. One may be certain that bricks and mortar(,) will long have gone out of fashion.\nBut the problems of the next generation or two can more readily be imagined. Scientists have already pointed out that unless something is done either to restrict the world's rapid growth in population or to discover and develop new sources of food (or both), millions of people will be dying of starvation or at the best suffering from underfeeding before this century is out. But nobody has yet worked out any plan for housing these growing populations. Admittedly the worst situations will occur in the hottest parts of the world, where housing can be light structure or in backward areas where standards are traditionally low. But even the minimum shelter requires materials of some kind and in the teeming, bulging towns the low-standard \"housing\" of flattened petrol cans and dirty canvas is far more wasteful of ground space than can be tolerated.\nSince the war, Hong Kong has suffered the kind of crisis which is likely to arise in many other places during the next generation. Literally millions of refugees arrived to swell the already growing population and emergency steps had to be taken rapidly to prevent squalor and disease and the spread crime. The city is tackling the situation energetically and enormous blocks of tenements are rising at an astonishing aped. But Hong Kong is only one small part of what will certainly become a vast problem and not merely a housing problem, because when population grows at this rate there are accompanying problems of education, transport, hospital services, drainage, water supply and so on.

You can infect  others one day before symptoms develop and for up to five days after becoming sick.\nGetting a flu vaccination is the best way to prevent the illness. Even if your body has built up antibodies for one kind of flu. The vaccine is only effective for one year and viruses are different from year to year, so it is necessary to get a flu vaccination every year. The best time to get the vaccination is October or November. Besides, there are other ways to reduce your chance of getting a flu. Wash your hands. Get enough rest. Eat garlic regularly.

His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said.

He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark.

It looks like they must bump into each other, but It's amazing that they all manage to reach the other side safely.\nBut the real reason I'm here is that I want to see people crash. I want businessmen to knock into each other, their umbrellas flying off their arms, and uniformed schoolchildren hitting grannies. Why may I see this now, but wouldn't have had the chance even a year ago? It's very simple - smartphones.\nSmartphone use is booming in Japan. In 2012, only about a quarter of Japanese used them, most being perfectly happy with their everyday mobiles. But now more than half of all Japanese now own a smartphone and the number is rising fast. But with that rise has grown another phenomenon - the smartphone walk. Those people who're staring at a phone screen adopt this kind of pace- their head down, arms outreached, looking like zombies trying to find human prey .\nSurprisingly, an American named Michael Cucek who has lived here for more than 20 years told me smartphone walk probably wouldn't be a long-term problem. Japanese phone manner is in fact better than anywhere else in the world - hardly anyone speaks on their phones on trains, and teenagers wouldn't dare broadcast music out of one. If things got truly bad at Shibuya, the police would just start shouting at people to look up.\nBut really, is the smartphone walk such an annoying problem? There's only one way to find out. So I leave the coffee shop, head down to the crossing and start typing an email, promising myself I won't look up until I get to the other side. When they start walking past me, it's my time to cross. As I step forward, the experience quickly becomes nervous - legs jump in and out of my vision without warning, while shopping bags fly towards my face before being pulled away at the last moment. I'm sure I'm going to get hit, but after a few seconds I relax. It's OK. Everyone's reacting for me.\nI expect to see two smartphone walkers just like me. But instead I find a young couple, very much in love and very much refusing to let each other's hands go just to give way to a fool on his smartphone. The girl gives me such a look of dislike that I quickly apologize and rush round them. That look was enough to ensure I'll never be smartphone walking again.", "id": "high9070.txt", "specific_questions": ["How does Michael Cucek find smartphone walk in Japan?"], "cloze_questions": ["After smartphone walking himself, the author thinks  _  ."], "general_questions": ["How does the author confirm whether smartphone walk is annoying or not?", "Why does the author stand in a coffee shop above Shibuya crossing?"]}, "gqt_qgg": ["Why has smartphone use boomed in Japan in recent years?", "What is the phenomenon known as smartphone walk?", "How does Michael Cucek view smartphone manners in Japan compared to the rest of the world?", "What does the author experience when attempting to cross Shibuya crossing while typing an email?", "How does the young couple react when the author encounters them while smartphone walking?", "What percentage of Japanese now own smartphones?", "How is Shibuya crossing described in the article?", "What is the author's initial motivation for observing people in Shibuya crossing?", "How does the author's experience at Shibuya crossing change their behavior regarding smartphone walking?", "What measures could be taken to address the issue of smartphone walking at Shibuya crossing?"]}, {"data": {"answers": ["C", "A", "B", "B"], "options": [["His mother.", "His father.", "His sister.", "The writer."], ["His sister died in a car accident.", "His father left him with his mother.", "His father was killed by a drunk driver.", "His mother left him with his sister."], ["Rich.", "Kind.", "Brave.", "Careful."], ["Christmas shopping", "A special gift", "A poor boy", "Great love"]], "questions": ["Who did the boy buy the gift for?", "What happened to the boy?", "What do you think of the writer?", "What's the best title for the passage?"], "article": "I hurried into the store to get Christmas gifts.

I watched him turn to a woman and say, \"Are you sure I don't have enough money?\" She said yes and told the boy not to go anywhere before she came back. Then she left.\nThe boy continued to hold the doll. I asked the boy who the doll was for. He said, \"It's the doll that my sister wanted so badly for Christmas. She just knew that Santa would bring it.\" I told him that Santa was going to bring it. He said, \"No, Santa can't go where my sister is. I have to give the doll to my mom to take it to her.\"\nI asked him where his sister was. He looked at me sadly and said, \"She's gone to heaven. My daddy said that Mom was going to be there with her.\" My heart nearly stopped beating. Then the boy said, \"I told my daddy to tell her not to go there until I got back.\" He took out some pictures of him and said, \"I want my mom to take these with her so she'll never forget me. I love my mom so much that I wish she didn't have to leave me, but Daddy said that she needed to be with my sister.\"\nThe boy lowered his head. While he was not looking, I reached into my purse and asked him, \"Shall we count that money again?\" He grew excited and said, \"Yes, I just know it has to be enough.\" So I put my money with his and we began to count it. He said, \"Thank you for giving me enough money.\" He continued, \"I just asked God to give me enough money to buy this doll, and he heard my _ .\"\nSoon the woman came back and I left. I remembered a story I had read in the newspaper several days earlier about a drunk driver who hit a car. A little girl was killed and her mother was in serious condition.
