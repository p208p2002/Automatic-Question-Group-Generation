            "article": "Have you heard of the scandal that happened in one of Great Britain's biggest supermarket chains called Tesco? The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.\nOn January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.\nIn times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.\nHowever, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!\nBy the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.\nBut this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken. So the next time you are in a supermarket maybe check the ingredients of your food before you buy it or you could get a nasty surprise ...",

            "article": "Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.\n\"All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'\" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. \"There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.\"\n    Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research becameprefix = st1 /NewSchoolUniversityto reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has  _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"theNewSchool\".\n    Changes in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east ofSan Francisco.\n    Beaver College turned itself intoArcadiaUniversityin 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and \"morning zoo\" radio shows.\nMany college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average student's test score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadiaspokeswoman, said.",

            "article": "Trees are useful to man in three very important ways: they provide him with wood and other products, they give him shade, and they help to prevent drought and floods.\nUnfortunately, in many parts of the world man has not realized that the third of these services is the most important. In his eagerness to draw quick profit from the trees, he has cut them down in large numbers, only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had.\nTwo thousand years ago a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire. It gained the empire but, without its trees, its soil became hard and poor. When the empire fell to pieces, the country found itself faced by floods and starvation.\nEven though a government realizes the importance of a plentiful supply of trees, it is difficult for it to persuade the villager to see this. The villager wants wood to cook his food with, and he can earn money by making charcoal  or selling wood to the townsman . He is usually too lazy or too careless to plant and look after trees. So unless the government has a good system of control, or can educate the people, the forests will slowly disappear.\nThis does not only mean that the villager's sons and grandsons have fewer trees. The results are even more serious. For where there are trees their roots break the soil up--allowing the rain to sink in and also hold the soil, thus preventing it being washed away easily, but where there are no trees, the soil becomes hard and poor. The rain falls on hard ground and flows away on the surface, causing floods and carrying away with it the rich topsoil, in which crops grow so well. When all the topsoil is gone, nothing remains but a worthless desert.",

            "article": "Jogging has become the most popular individual sport in America. Many theories,even some mystical ones,have been advanced to explain the popularity of jogging. The plain truth is that jogging is a cheap,quick and efficient way to maintain (or achieve) physical fitness.\nThe most useful sort of exercise is exercise that develops the heart,lungs, and circulatory systems. If these systems are fit,the body is ready for almost any sport and for almost any sudden demand made by work or emergencies. One can train more specifically,as by developing strength for weight lifting or the ability to run straight ahead for short distances with great power as in football,but running trains your heart and lungs to deliver oxygen more efficiently to all parts of your body. It is worth doing that: this sort of exercise is the only kind that can reduce heart disease, the number one cause of death in America.\nOnly one sort of equipment is needed--a pair of good shoes. Physicians advise beginning joggers not to try to run in tennis or gym shoes. Many design advances have been made in only the last several years that make a pair of excellent running shoes indispensable if a runner wishes to develop as quickly as possible,with as little chance of injury as possible. A pair of good running shoes will have soft pads for absorbing shock, as well as slightly built-up heels and full heel cups that will give the knee and ankle more stability. A wise investment in good shoes will prevent blisters and the foot,ankle and knee injuries and will also enable the wearer to run on paved or soft surfaces. No other special equipment is needed; you can jog in any clothing you desire,even your street clothes.\nIt takes surprisingly little time to develop the ability to run. The American Jogging Association has a twelve-week program designed to move from a fifteen- minute walk (which almost anyone can manage who is in reasonable health) to a thirty-minute run. A measure of common sense,a physical examination,and a planned schedule are all it takes.",

Some days ago, Xiao Baiyou's latest book about how to be a successful parent came out. He is pretty strict with his four children. Sometimes he even beat them. But the children don't hate their daddy at all. And all of them finally went to Pecking University, one of the top universities in China. So Xiao proudly tells others about his education idea that children need strict rules. In his microblog, he said, \"Come on, want your children to enter Peking University without rules? You must be joking.\" And, \"Leave your children more money, and strict rules at the same time.\"But the \"Wolf Daddy\" way was soon questioned by other parents. Some say that Xiao Baiyou just want to be famous by doing so. The \"Wolf Daddy\" Xiao Baiyou is a 47-year-old Guangdong businessman who deals in luxury goods  in Hong Kong. Unlike many other parents who usually have one child, Xiao has four children. Two of them were born in Hong Kong and two in the US. Some people on the Internet think the reason why his children were able to enter Peking University is because the exam is much easier taken from Hong Kong.",

Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learnt to sleep, in the passage of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep.\nCarrying all your possessions on your back  in a tucksack  makes you have a vefy basic approach to travel,and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead  to burning socks that have become too anti-social ,and getting rid of books when finished.On the other hand, _ is entirely in the spirit of Inter--Rail,for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks.All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand.\nAny system that enables young people to travef through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty social on that first trip,my friehds mad I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket,thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen camp-site in southern France.But the idea of non-stop travel proved too attractive,for there was always just one more country over the border,always that little bit further to go.And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing.\nWe were not completely uninterested in culture.But this was a first holiday without parents,as it was for most other Inter-Railers,and in organizing our own timetable  we left out everything except the most available sights.This was the chance to escape the guided tour,an opportunity to do something different.I took great pride in the fact that.in many places,all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station.We were just there to get by,and to have good time doing so.In this we were not different from most of the other Inter-Raiders with whom we shared passage  floors,food and water,money and music.\nThe excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.It is as if the city in which you arrive never actually existed until the train pulls in at the station and you are able to see it with your own tired eyes for the first time.",

Will Crusoe find another human being to end his loneliness? Is the footprint the sign of an enemy? Since 1719, when Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, thousands of people who enjoy English novels have thrilled to this great adventure story. But few know how the story came to be written. Robinson Crusoe was the first English novel. Its birth brought together the misadventures of a Scotch \"failure\" and the untapped imagination of an aging English scribbler.\n     Near the end of the Seventeenth Century, the hot-tempered Alexander Selkirk was charged with bad conduct while in church. Rather than face this charge, he ran away to sea. Several years later, Selkirk found himself on the ship of an English privateer. The privateer was preying on Spanish shipping. But Selkirk quarreled bitterly with the Captain. So, when the ship came to the island of Juan Femandez in the South Seas, Selkirk asked to be put ashore. When he saw that there were no people on the island, he begged to be taken back on board. But the Captain refused--Selkirk had gone too far. Over four years later, Selkirk was rescued by another ship.\nWhen Selkirk got back to England, the story of his life on the island fired the imagination of Daniel Defoe. Defoe had been earning a living by his pen since he was thirty. He was amazingly hard-working. He wrote a whole newspaper three times a week. He also made part of his living from politics. He supported both political parties. He told each party that it had his sole support.\nDefoe's morals were weak. But he was a fine writer. He was almost sixty when, in the midst of his work in politics, he wrote Robinson Crusoe. In it, Defoe--said one critic--\"forged  a story, and forced it on the world for truth.\" The detail of Crusoe's battle for survival on a lonely island is so vivid that the reader of Robinson Crusoe accepts the product of the author's imagination for reality. Robinson Crusoe became the first of a long line of heroes and heroines that have peopled English novels since Defoe's time.",

Instead of golden palaces, there were grass huts and palm-leaf tents. Instead of silk-robed merchant princes, he found \"Indians\" who did not have so much as a shirt on their backs.\nWhen Columbus explored the West Indies in 1493,he heard tales of a fierce Indian tribe who literally devoured its defeated enemies after a battle. These people were called by many names in the area, including Calina, Canima, Carib, and Caniba. Columbus recorded the name of the American natives as Canibales in Spanish, a word which came to refer, within a few years, to any eater of human flesh. In the similar fashion, the word Caribbean, a title for the sea as well as for the region, came into English.\nAt times Columbus knew that this new land was not China, not Japan, not the Spice Islands. He seemed to accept it as a part of the earth that the geographers of Europe had never heard of before. It was another world--and he called it exactly that--but Columbus also insisted until he died that land he had reached was an unknown part of Asia.",

I took courses in weather science at Eastern Kentucky University, but I majored in broadcasting news.\nHow did you finally become a weatherman?\nMy first job in the early 1980s was at the local TV station in Paducah, Kentucky. I did everything from turning on the lights in the morning to writing and delivering morning news. I put together weather forecasts, and became interested in them.\nBack then, how did you forecast weather?\nIndependent companies collected computer information that showed, for example, how a single weather system might split into snow or snow mixed with rain. The information was often opposite and the job of a weatherman was to study the information and make the best educated guess about the storm.\nHas weather forecasting changed much with new technology?\nAdvanced computers, satellites, and Doppler radar (sound waves used to track storms) have made forecasting more exact. But we still know very little about how weather is shaped. So far, we just have theories.\nAny advice for children who'd like to become weather scientists?\nTo me, weather is the most exciting field in the world. There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can't foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we? Weather forecasting is wide open for scientists who love to solve puzzling problems. The next generation of meteorologists (weather scientists) will unlock many of Earth's weather secrets. So get a general knowledge of Earth science, and study meteorology in college.\nThanks, Sam.",

It's important to do so in a proper way, no matter whether you are introducing yourself to someone, or introducing two people. To keep you aware of this, we have gathered tips on how to make a proper introduction.\n*Always stand when making an introduction.\nWhen you are seated and someone comes up to greet you, make the effort to stand up. By doing this, you show respect for yourself and for the other person.\n*Always keep eye contact while making an introduction.\nMany people are not aware of the value of this simple action. When you make eye contact, you are giving a confident image.\n*Always introduce a person of lesser authority to one of greater authority. The most important thing to remember is to say the most important person's name first.\nFor example, when introducing your supervisor to a job candidate  , you would give your supervisor's name first. \"Bob Jones, may I introduce Susan Lee, who has just graduated from ABC University?\"\n*In a situation where rank is unimportant, an introduction is based on sex and age. A man is presented to a woman and a younger woman to an older woman.\nWhat if you find yourself in a situation where you have forgotten the other person's name? Start with a handshake and reintroduce   yourself. When doing this, you will usually cause the other person to do the same.\nHowever, if the other person does not take your suggestion, it is OK simply to apologize and let the person know that you cannot remember her or his name. This is not the ideal situation, of course, but it does happen to all of us. The other person should be forgiving.",

She had planned what to do after graduation in the UK: two years' work experience at a restaurant and a tour around Europe. But now her plans are up in the air.\n         Following the UK Home Secretary's meeting on reform of the student immigration system, the UK government recently announced the end of the post-study work visa from April 2012. This will force tens of thousands of Chinese students to leave the UK after graduation.\n         Sadly, the domestic job market doesn't welcome them with open arms. A report by Tigtag.com at the end of 2011 showed that over 35 percent of students admitted that they have employment problems.\n         \"Returning students often have fluent English, creative minds and a serious attitude toward work,\" said Zhang Tingwen, an HR expert in ChinaHR.com. \"But lack of work experience is a big problem.\" Xia Lei, an HR manager, responded to Zhang. \"We need people who can work for us. We don't need people from big name universities to attract customers\".\n         Difference in work practices is another problem that worries employers, Zhang pointed out. \"Some returning students might be used to Western ways of dealing with people and things.\"\n         Huang Shanshan, 25, got a job in a communication company in Shenzhen.   \"I once worked part-time in UK.

This earthquake happened in 1556.\n         Earthquakes worry people a lot. The reason is that we often do not know when they are coming. People can not prepare for it. Although we cannot stop earthquakes, there are things which can be done to protect ourselves during an earthquake.",

            "article": "How much should you save? You may be able to save 100% of your money. Does that mean you should? Not at all. The best way to develop good saving habits is to make saving a regular part of your life, along with spending.\nHere is the rule you should remember: save before spending. Whenever some money gets into your hands, from a job or your pocket money or whatever, take your savings out immediately, before spending any of the money. The beauty of this system is that if you take away your savings, you are free to spend the rest.\nHere are some more suggestions on how to successfully get into the saving habit from teens. Let's see!\nTony,13: I put my money in a bank instead of my wallet, so the money is not there. And I have to take an extra step to get it.\nBill,14: When considering a major purchase , wait a week or so, at least. This will help you make sure if you still want it, and the price might go down.\nDick, 13: Carry very little money always. You can't spend money if you don't have it. A cake would be nice, but without a dollar, you can't get it. Little things like that really add up quickly.\nSteve,16: I used to be weak when it came to money. I bought something whenever I went into a store. I'm glad I'm not that person now. I taught myself discipline by keeping a $20 bill in my pocket while waking around the mall all day and not buying anything. Now I have no strong wish to buy things when I go into a store. It works for me.\nThese ideas should help you get started. If you have some questions about anything you've read here, or would like to share your ideas about saving money, please write to us.",

Sometimes he painted the natural look of things. Sometimes he seemed to break them apart and throw the pieces in our faces. He showed us what the mind knows as well as what the eyes see.

A lot of school rules are similar around the world, but some are different. Some students may enjoy more freedom in some countries. But freedom doesn't mean \"no rules\". Every school has its own rules.\nThere are some rules in Japanese schools. The students are not allowed to dye their hair and are supposed to keep their hair black. They are not allowed to wear earrings either. Almost all schools used to require students to wear school uniforms but now half of the schools require uniforms. The students feel happy to wear all kinds of clothes. The students must get to school on time. If they are late, they cannot get into the school because the school gate is closed. In Japan, students are not allowed to have part-time jobs.\nAmerican schools have their own rules too. For example, at Morton High School, students are not allowed to choose their own clothes. They must get to school or leave school on time. Food, drinks or snacks shouldn't be taken into the classroom. They must wear sports shoes in PE class. They are supposed to keep quiet on the school bus. In America, the students can have part-time jobs in their free time. (<<>> )",

So thankful and happy, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed  the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, \"Who helped me?\"\n\"It was Time, \"Knowledge answered.\n\"Time?\"asked Love.\"But why did Time help me?\"\nKnowledge smiled with deep wisdom  and answered, \"Because only Time is able to understand how valuable Love is.\"",

            "article": "Alice's mother died when she was five. Although her brothers and sisters were loving and caring, their love couldn't take the place of a mother's. In 1925 Alice became my mother and told me that her family couldn't even afford her a doll.\nOne afternoon in December 1982, when I was getting ready for Christmas, I suddenly decided to buy two dolls, one for my five-year-old daughter, Katie, and one for my old mother.\nThings went smoothly when a friend told me that his dad, who played Santa Claus in my area, would be willing to make a visit on Christmas morning to our home with the gifts! Knowing that my parents would also come to my house, I began to get ready for the most memorable day of my mother's life.\nChristmas Day arrived and so did Santa Claus at the planned time. Katie was very excited and happy all the time to welcome the Santa. My mother was enjoying watching Katie welcoming this special guest. As Santa turned to leave he looked again into his bag and took out one more gift. As he asked who Alice was, my mother, without thinking of her name being called, said that she in fact was Alice. Santa handed her the gift with a message card that read:\nFor Alice:\nI was cleaning out my sleigh   before my trip this year and came across this package that should be sent on December 25, 1925. The gift inside has aged, but I felt that you might still wish to have it. Many apologies for the lateness of the gift.\nLove,\nSanta Claus\nMy mother was very excited and deeply moved to tears. She couldn't speak but only held tightly in her arms the doll she had waited fifty-seven years to receive as tears of joy flew down her face. That doll made my mother the happiest \"child\".",

The frame was made of silver, with an elegant flower design in one corner. The photograph was taken in March 1939 on their wedding day. Emily looked very happy, and Gordon looked rather alarmed.  A few months later, he was killed in action in North Africa. I received the photograph when my aunt Mabel died.\n   I'm a student at Edinburgh University and I live in an old Edwardian house.  At the end of last term, I packed a large bag and a small bag and set off for London, where I was planning to catch the Eurostar train to Paris. Minutes after getting off the train at Kings Cross Station, I realized that I'd left the small bag in the overhead luggage rack. I ran back to the train, but it had already left the platform.\n   This all happened several months ago, and I had become resigned to the loss of my most precious possession. Then last week, something extraordinary happened. I logged onto the site Bay and looked for a silver photo frame and I found it ! The photo of my great grandparents was on Bay !\n   I called the person who was advertising it. He was a little suspicious at first, and told me that he had bought it from a stall at an antique market. After we talked for a while, he asked if there was any way I could prove it was mine. All I could think of was that the photo was taken in March 1939. He opened the frame and made sure that this date was written by hand on the back of the photograph.\n  \"It ' s definitely yours. \" he said.  \"Come and get it ! \"\n5(11)",

Student editors  at a French newspaper for kids called \"Mon Quotidien\", do every day.\nThe 10-year-old newspaper has its headquarters   in Paris. Sometimes the newspaper sells 200,000 copies every day. It gets more than one million dollars every year! This is much more than other newspapers.\nHow do they decide what to put in the paper? All the adult editors working on the children's daily agree that the paper should be easy and simple to read. Kids should be able to finish it within 10 minutes.\nThe paper covers school life, animals, and science, which are usually kid's favourite subjects. It also talks about big world problem, like the Iraq   war.\nIn order to make the paper more popular with kids, adult editors invite students from age 10 to 15 to take part in their meetings. They have meetings every Wednesday and Sunday. Adult editors, reporters and kids sit together and decide which topics should come out in the paper and on which page.\nWhich topic should come out on the front page, European Union   or bears in the zoo? Often the kid editors and adult writers disagree. Sometimes, the adult editors have to give up because their little editors won't give in.\nUsually the student editors stay in the newspaper office for three hours at each meeting. Any kid in France can call the newspaper if they are interested in being a one-day editor.",

            "article": "Iceland, an island just south of the Arctic Circle, has fairly mild winters,  thanks to warm ocean currents. Time your vacation here during the winter months to take advantage of off-season deals.\nOff-season means good deals on flights, hotels and tours. You may also find that the locals are a bit friendlier and more welcoming when tourists aren't arriving in crowds.\nIn the winter months, there are less than seven hours of daylight; thus, chances are good you'll catch sight of the northern lights. Sunsets are also beautiful at this time, making for some great photo opportunities.\nIn Iceland, winter is the perfect time to hike glaciers, go ice climbing, explore caves made out of hardened lava  and much more. One of the most popular activities is off-roading  in a specially-equipped \"super jeep\".\nBefore booking your trip, be sure to check for volcano alerts. There are about 130 volcanoes on or around Iceland. Thirty-five of them are active. In 2010, a volcano named Eyjaallajokull exploded, sending clouds of ash up to four kilometers into the atmosphere. The ash drifted toward the UK and Europe. Because the ask could damage aircraft engines, airlines operating in the region were forced to cancel flights for six days. As a result, thousands of people were stuck in airports.\nRecently, another volcano named Bardarbunga has become active, erupting ash into the air. Such events, if large enough, could prevent your trip from going ahead. So check the latest volcano news prior to making your reservations.",

Five years later, while fighting Patsy Cardiff at Minneapolis, Sullivan broke his right arm in the third round, but he continued fighting to the sixth round and won. In 1889, Sullivan defeated Jade Kilrain with his bare fists in another championship fight, winning twenty thousand dollars and a diamond prize medal. His admirers talked then of running him for the next governor, but he traveled to Australia for a boxing tour instead, coming back only to lose his title in a twenty-one-round match with a young Californian named James J. Corbett.\n\"Gentleman James\" victory in this match marked a turning point, for it showed scientific boxing was over strength. But Corbett's title ended in 1897, when another boxer, Bob Fitzsimmons, in less than three seconds, achieved his feats and then Fitzsimmons knocked out an Irishman, won the heavyweight championship of the world, and invented the terrible \"solar plexus punch.\"",

So I had studied for about two hours the night before. After reviewing it for some time, I had started to understand it, so then I closed the book and  _ . However, it was not until midnight that I fell asleep. The next day, when I got the test, it might as well have been written in Serbian (which I don't know how to read). I tried my best to work out the hard problems, but the numbers I came up with were strange. I sat back on my chair and looked for any possible answers, but I could not remember anything or think correctly. I started thinking about my dad coming home from work to find that I failed the test ...\n\"How could you have failed the test? I am certain that nobody else in the whole class got as bad a grade as you did!\"\nNaturally I didn't want that to happen. My dad was also really busy at work at present, so I was afraid that this might make him mad. When feeling hopeless, I noticed that my table partner was writing fast on his test. I could see smoke rising up from how fast he was writing. I was attracted to look over at his test, but then the many bad results I had heard about cheating   came into my mind. I reasoned that if I started cheating now, it would be hard to give up that habit during high school. In the end, I decided not to copy his answers, and got a B- on that test. Even though my dad gave me a hard time about it, it would have been a lot worse if he found out that I had given in and cheated.",

            "article": "There are many acceptable varieties of English throughout the world. Whichever variety is used in your country, the most important thing is that students' pronunciation must be good enough for another person to understand what they are trying to say.\nIn a PPP lesson, teachers naturally include a good model of the pronunciation when they are presenting new vocabulary, grammar or functional language. It is important to start by helping your students recognize sounds before you expect them to produce them.\nSpoken British English has 44 sounds, but there are only 26 letters in the alphabet for written English. This sometimes makes English pronunciation and spelling different, so it is not always best to write words on the blackboard at the early stages. Also, some sounds in English do not exist in some other languages. This can make it very difficult for students to recognize these sounds and even more difficult for them to pronounce them correctly. So some students need to do a lot of work on these sounds, listening to them, trying to recognize them and trying to copy them.\nIf you can understand and pronounce the symbols of the phonetic alphabet, this will help you to pronounce any word in the dictionary. You can teach this phonetic alphabet to your students and this will make teaching pronunciation much easier. However, you can teach pronunciation effectively without knowing the phonetic alphabet. Pronouncing English well is not just about getting the individual sounds right. Students need to know:\n* which parts of a word are stressed (spoken louder and longer);\n* which parts of a sentence are stressed;\n* basic intonation patterns;\n* what it means when we change the intonation in a sentence (the music of the language);\n* how to link together the sounds within a sentence.\nStudents need practice in all these areas to improve their pronunciation.",

Others are not comfortable with any stress at alls they soon become unhappy if they feel stressed. Sometimes stress can lead people to do things they wouldn't usually do, such as overeat, smoke, drink, or use drugs. Streas, however, is a very normal part of life.\nIt is important to understand that stress doesn't come from an event itself, that is, from the things that are happening in our lives. It comes from the meaning we give to what has happened. For example, a crying baby may be stressful to one person, but it may not bother another person at all, a traffic jam may be stressful to one person while another person may be able to stay calm.\nWe can experience stress any time we feel we don't have control. It can come from a feeling that we can't do anything about a situation. Basically, it is the body's way of showing anxiety or worry.\nStress is not just caused by our mental or emotional condition. It is also influenced by how tired we are, whether we have a balanced diet with enough vitamins and minerals, whether we get enough physical exercise, and whether we can relax.\nThe key point of relieving the stress is that we need to find what is causing the stress in our lives. Once we have found it, we should try to change that part of out lives. If we believe that we can control stress, we can begin to control out lives. Then we can start to use stress in positive way.",

Every set of fingerprints has different \"ridge characteristics\" (i. e. the print of each separate finger is different from that of all the other fingers), which belong to one of four basic groups: arches, loops, whorls and composites.

            "article": "When I opened my e-mail the other day, a pretty woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen. She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm . Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss. She was reading to me an e-mail from my brother, and a lot of it was about the trouble he had getting the phone company to give him a high-speed Internet connection. It was pretty cool.\nRachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail. An ace man lets you send an e-mail that gets ready to the recipient by an attractive male or female from or by a clown . The software, which is free, can be downloaded at www.facemail.com.\nFacemail faces are lifelike, and they simulate emotions based on emotions-for example, that you put in your text. Type in; -x, and Rachel blows a kiss.\nLife Fx, the company that develops the Facemail, is sure there are broad business uses. The reason e-business is not popular, the company says, is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch. But what if you went to the Nike website and Michel Jordan greeted you by name, waited on you and personally closed the sale? And it is talking with Whirlpool about using the technology in a computer screen on a fridge. Then if Mom can't be home when the kids get back from school, she can leave a note with voice and image telling them what there is to eat. Facemail could get hot fast. Personally, I'm a fan. But Facemail should be used with care. The clown looks lively and funny at first. But if you select the clown, put a few rude words in an e-mail and add some angry emotions, you're got Psycho-mail .",

It found that human-influenced climate change was raising the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition   and heat-related health problems.\nBut even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.\nAlong with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.\nRoger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the Forum's report was \"a methodological embarrassment\" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable   regions. Dr. Pielke said that \"climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost   attention.\" But the report, he said, \"will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed  .\"\nHowever, Soren Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. He said the report was aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.\nIn a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability  to climate hazards while still curbing   the emissions of the heat-trapping gases. More than 90% of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.",

But Joe's parents are too busy to spend enough time with her, which makes Joe more than lonely. So, she always goes to WeChat. On WeChat, she can do a lot of things like buying things, reading articles, and making friends with those she either knows or not.\nShe uses the name Linda on WeChat and has made a lot of friends there. Last year Joe made a foreign friend on WeChat. Her name was Catherine and she lived in Sydney. Catherine once sent a picture of \"herself\": a tall, good-looking young woman with big eyes. Catherine and Joe were both interested in rock music and modern dance. So, they liked each other very much.\nWhen Joe's father told her that he was meeting a client in Sydney this summer, she went with him to give Catherine a surprise for her birthday. When Joe came to Catherine's house in Sydney, she found that her foreign \"girlfriend\" was a ten-year-old boy named Jim! What a surprise!",

But when hard times call, animal fathers can be really a danger to their own kids.\nDaddy Lion\nA combination of laziness, pride, cruelty and anger makes the lion one of the most fearsome and worst dads of the animal kingdom. When not walking proudly across the jungle, the father lion just lazes around under the sun, or waits for one of its lioness  partners to bring back food. Once the lioness gets home the food, the lion eats up most of it, and leaves little or nothing at all for the kids. The father doesn't even train the kids for hunting and surviving, it is the lioness who teaches them how to _ themselves.\nThe Polar Father\nCute, pure and soft. Protective of young ones and family? Sure. But what makes the polar bears one of the worst dads of the animal kingdom? They don't take care of the young ones, they won't take up the responsibility of feeding them, they won't take care of them like a father should. They just leave that to the mother bear.\nThe Assassin Bug \nSize matters, you say? This little bug would eat its own eggs to stay strong and fulfill its hunger needs. The male assassin bug is actually responsible for guarding the eggs. The female assassin bug lays eggs in large numbers. The male bug eats the weaker eggs.\nDaddy Bass \nUsually, water calms you down. Not so much for this underwater species. The male bass is known to eat up eggs from its own spawn. It guards the spawn(,) laid by its female partner. However, when hungry and unable to hunt for food, the father won't think twice before eating up the eggs.\nAnd do you think your father was strict and hard? After reading this article, I'm sure you think your dad is the best in the whole wide world for not eating you up!",

The light lasted very short, and changed into red in no time. I noticed that both the man and his wife had crossed along with me and the old lady was left behind. I quickly realized what happened.\nWhen the light turned dreen again, I ran over to the other side, offered the old lady my right hand and we quickly walked together to the other side of the road. I used my left hand to stop any oncoming   traffic so that even if the crossing signal turned red, we cuold make it to the other side safely. In the meantime, both the man and his wife realized that they had left the old woman behind and they ran back.. The old lady was in tears and told me, \"Young man, you are more caring   than my son,\" and then gave me a warm handshake  . The man and woman were sorry about what happened and also thanked me.

His victim, who picked up the ticket, then claimed the PS25000 prize, managed to trace him, and handed over the cash. The robbery happened when maths professor Vinicio Sabbatucci,58, was changing a tyre on an Italian motorway. Another motorist, who stopped  \"to help\", stole a suitcase from his car and drove off. The professor found the dropped ticket and put it in his pocket before driving home to Ascoli in eastern Italy.\n    Next day, he saw the lottery results on TV and, taking out the ticket, realized it was a winner. He claimed the 60 million lire  prize. Then he began a battle with his conscience. Finally, he decided he could not keep the money despite having been robbed. He advertised in newspapers and on radio, saying: \"I'm trying to find the man who robbed me. I have 60 million for him--- a lottery win. Please meet me. Anonymity  guaranteed.\"\n    Professor Sabbatucci received hundreds of calls from people hoping to trick him into handing them the cash. But there was one voice he recognized--- and he arranged to meet the man in a park. The robber, a 35-year-old unemployed father of two, gave back the suitcase and burst into tears. He could not believe what was happening. \"Why didn't you keep the money?\" he asked. The professor replied:\" I couldn't because it's not mine.\" Then he walked off, spurning the thief's offer of a reward.",

Yes, he is Chow Yun-fat.\nThe example of his long hard struggle for success has been used in a chapter in a Hong Kong middle school textbook. Using his experience, students can learn to make the most of their time and to grab every opportunity to succeed.\nOn hearing about this, Chow said happily, \"I really hope that my experiences can make young people understand that one should not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks  , for they are the only way to success.\"\nIndeed, Chow has travelled a long and difficult path to reach his success. In 1955, he was born into a poor family in Hong Kong. When he was 17, he had to leave school. He worked in a number of jobs--as a postman, camera salesman and taxi driver. These experiences paved   the way for him to play all kinds of roles later in life.\nChow broke into the film industry in the late 1970s. He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including \"Shanghai Bund\"(<<>> ) and \"A Better Tomorrow\". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards.\nIn 1995, he went to Hollywood. Although he was already over 40, he had to learn English. _ His film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", began to gain him more fame and recognition around the world. In 1998, the mayor of Chicago set aside January 12 as \"Chow Yun-fat Day\".",

He lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to live with us.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.\"\n\"No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us.\"\n\"Son,\" said the father, \"you don't know what you're asking. Someone like the young man would be a terrible burden for us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let something like this stay with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He'll find a way to live on his own.\"\nAt that point, the son hung up the phone. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling down from a building. The police believed it was suicide .\nThe parents flew to San Francisco. To their surprise, they found their son had only one arm and one leg.\nThe parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun, but we don't like people who make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are.",

            "article": "My mother, Marisol Torres, came with her family to Australia in the early 1960s. Then my parents' marriage ended and Mum began the study of precious stones. Her interest in opals   took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge. There were no luxuries  , but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money.\nMy mother was beautiful with dark hair and brown eyes, but she was also quiet and shy. Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends.\nIt was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never very successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile.\nThen, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon. In her honour, my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year.\nPeople who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society, from lawyers to travels. Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents.\nThen there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke. Luke is a shy 19-year-old boy who enjoys helping his dad. They haven't had much luck over the past couple of years, but their passion for opals conquers disappointment. They love the peaceful lifestyle.\nDanny Hatcher, 38, is a second-generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners' Association. He is an optimistic man, driven by the desire to find the perfect opal. \"It's magic,\" he explains. \"Once you start opal mining you don't want to do anything else... There is always the potential for finding a million dollars. Nothing beats it.\"\nIt's a place where dreams --- spiritual or material --- can be fulfilled; a place, for one last bet in life.",

He had been forced to take a job stocking shelves at a local grocery store for $8.90 an hour when he couldn't get work fixing floors.\nOn a good day in Australia, he now makes as much as 50 Australian dollars (US$50.21) an hour--about twice the amount for a typical flooring job in the U.S. He plans to start his own flooring business. \n\"I can make what I did in a week in the U.S. in less than a day here,\" said Mr. Davila, who lives near a mining boom town in Western Australia.\nAustralian government figures show just under 7,000 Americans currently working on long-term visas, an 80% jump over the past five years. U.S. citizens are now the third-largest group applying for so-called 457 work visas, after British and Indian nationals. Americans with degrees in areas such as accounting or mine engineering, as well as other skilled workers, can obtain a nonrenewable  permit for as much as a three-year stay. After that, they can apply for the renewable 457, which allows up to a four-year stay. \nThe need for workers is particularly pressing in Western Australia. The mining state's unemployment rate was 4.5% in November, below the national average of 5.2%. Drivers of heavy trucks can pull in six-figure salaries while experienced crane   operators can earn hundreds of thousands a year. Attracting skilled workers is a shift for Australia, which historically sent many of its most highly educated to the U.S. and Europe, according to migration data.",

            "article": "He looked like a pirate.\nWith his handkerchief tied in a knot behind his little nine-year-old head, he looked like a pirate, a sad pirate. The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. He was also very angry.\nPaul Newman's camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears. After the hug and kiss, he put his hands on my shoulders, and tears still in his eyes, said: \"See you on the other side of the door, Fatha.\"",

He ran after a deer, and soon found himself alone. \"I ran after a deer, but I didn't get it,\" he said. \"Then I was really lost.\"\nHe had only his hunting rifle  and the clothes he was wearing. He had no food or water and had nothing that could help him find his way to safety. \"I knew that no one could hear me. I decided to just sleep and get up in the morning and find safety,\" he said.\nAustin climbed up on a rock and slept through the night. Then he awoke and relied on skills he learned in a hunter safety course. He followed a stream to an occupied cabin. The couple there called his parents and cooked him a breakfast. \" It's probably one meal I'll never forget for the rest of my life,\" he said.\nAfter DuVall's disappearance, a lot of emergency officials and more than 100 volunteers went searching for him. \"He wasn't sitting there waiting for someone to come and find him,\" said his father, Steve DuVall. \"We didn't find him; he found himself.\"\nMike Kintigh, regional supervisor for the Game, Fish & Parks Department, said one or two hunters will go missing each year, but rarely for more than 24 hours. \"We're a little bit unique in the Black Hills as it's hard to get lost for a very long time. That's because we've got so many roads here compared to the Rocky Mountains,\" Kintigh said. \"You can certainly spend a very uncomfortable night in the woods like Austin did.\"",

He was bothered by a large number of requests asking him to offer help that took advantage of his fame. \" I was upset the first several days after the prize announcement, but then I realized the prize is just like a mirror that reflects various attitudes about my winning, and more, reflects the real me,\" Mo said. \"I still consider myself an ordinary citizen who writes. And presenting quality works is my duty and best way of giving back to society. I'm no superstar,\" he emphasized  several times.\nMo believes Chinese literature has achieved much in the past thirty years, and the driving force behind that is not the prize. Writers' creations should not be driven by awards, or criticism, or readers' expectations. Mo said he misunderstood the standards of the academy's selection before he visited Stockholm  to receive the prize in December.\n\"I thought they were judging the authors' personality or political features, then I learned the sole standard of their selection is literature itself, which is also deeply based in the Swedish people's long-established practice of reading a large number of books,\" Mo said.\nDuring the forum, established Chinese and Australian writers discussed subjects as diverse as tradition and modernity, the local and the universe and cultural inclusiveness. And they will also read works to each other and the readers. The writers communication will further promote  Chinese writers to a global audience.\nAustralian Ambassador  to China Frances Adamson agreed. \"It's a milestone  of literary exchanges between the two countries, who are longtime friends,\" Adamson said.",

He put clues in the story to help readers find it. Thousands of people hunted for the treasure. They dug holes all over Britain, hoping to find it.\nOne of the most popular adventure stories ever written is Robert Louis Stephenson's \"Treasured Island\", an exciting story about a young boy, Jim Hawkins, who is captured by pirates   and later finds some buried treasure.\nThen there is the true story about a man who had to travel overseas for a year. He did not trust banks, so he buried his life savings in a park. Then he went away. On his return, he went straight to the park. But the park was no longer there. In its place there was a huge building.\nAnd then there was the man who buried his savings, all in bank notes, in a waterproof bag. When he dug it up years later, there was nothing left. Worms and insects had eaten the bag and everything in it.\nAnd of course, these are stories about people who bury things and either forget where they have buried them or lose the map.\nAlthough it is true that people sometimes lose their money because a bank fails, banks are still the safest place to keep our savings and treasures.",

My older bother and I lived with Mom in an ugly multi-family house in Detroit. We watched TV every night. The background noise of our lives was gunfire and horses'  hoofs  from \"Wagon Train\" or \"Cheyenne\", and laughter from\"I Love Lucy\", or\"Mister Ed\".After supper, we'd lie on Mom's bed and stare for hours at the TV screen.\nBut one day Mom changed our world forever. She turned off the TV. Our mother had only been able to get through third grade. But, she was much brighter and smarter than we boys know at the time. She had noticed something in the suburban houses where she cleaned books. So she came home one day, switched off the TV, sat us down and explained that her sons were going to make something of themselves. \"You boys are going to read two books every week,\" she said. \"And you're going to write a report on what you read.\"\nWe moaned(,) and complained about how unfair it was. Besides, we didn't have any books in the house other than Mom's Bible. But she explained that we would go where the books were: \"I'll drive you to the library.\"\nSo pretty soon there were these two peevish boys sitting in her white 1959 Oldsmobile on their way to Detroit Public Library. I wandered reluctantly  among the children's books. I loved animals, so when I saw some books that seemed to be about animals, I started leafing through them.\nThe first book I read clear through wasChip the Dam Builder. It was about beavers . For the first time in my life I was lost in another world. No television program had ever taken me so far away from my surroundings as did this virtue visit to a cold stream in a forest and these animals building a home.\nIt didn't dawn on me at the time, but the experience was quite different from watching TV. There were images forming in my mind instead of before my eyes. And I could return to them again and again with the flip of a page.\nSoon I began to look forward to visiting this quiet sanctuary form my other world. I moved from animals to plants, and then to rocks. Between the covers of all those books were whole worlds, and I was free to go anywhere in them. Along the way a funny thing happened: I started to know things. Teachers started to notice it too. I got to the point where I couldn't wait to get home to my books.\nNow my older brother is an engineer and I am chief of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore. Sometimes I still can't believe my life's journey, from a failing and indifferent student in a Detroit public school to this position, which takes me all over the world to teach and perform critical surgery.\nBut I know when the journey began the day Mom switched off the TV set and put us in her Oldsmobile for that drive to the library.",

Already there have been more than enough teachers, engineers, physicists, aerospace experts, and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren't there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree.\nOn the other hand, there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can deal with, and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old gap that white --collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true. The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen.\nThe reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree. Parents begin indoctrinating  their children with this myth before they are out of grade school. High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college, so of course they must go. And every year college enrollments  go up and up, and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them.\nOne result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ . Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college, half of them do not graduate with their class. Many of them drop out within the first year. Some struggle on for two or three years and then give up.",

I changed two players, but it didn't help.\nAt that time all our teammates felt worried and we even quarreled with each other angrily.  \"It's no use crying over spilt milk!\" I shouted, \"We must face it !\" Let's think about our mistakes and stop making them!\"\nWe had a short meeting . The second half of the match began. There was a big change. At first, our team got the ball and I shot from the three-point line at once. The ball did a beautiful curve and went straight into the basket.\nI become very confident. The other team was still very strong.\nA good chance came! I got the ball again and shot into the basket! 12:9! I couldn't believe my eyes! Am I that good at shooting? How could I get so many points?\nWe stayed in the lead. Finally the score was 18:16. We won!",

It came to drop of about twelve to fourteen feet. The water that rushed down all these small valleys in the rainy season had worn the rock as glass. As it was too deep to climb down, I handed my gun to one of the men and slid down it. My feet had hardly touched the sandy bottom when the two men jumped down, one on each side of me.

            "article": "History is full of cases where dreams have been a pathway to creativity and discovery. A striking example is provided by Dr. Otto Loewi, a pharmacologist and winner of a Nobel Prize. Loewi had spent years studying the chemical transmission  of nerve impulses  . A major breakthrough in his research came when he dreamed of an experiment three nights in a row. On the first two nights he woke up and wrote down the experiment quickly and untidily on paper. But the next morning, he couldn't tell what the notes meant. On the third night, he got up after having the dream. This time, instead of making notes he went straight to his laboratory and performed the important experiment. Loewi later said that if the experiment had occurred to him while awake he would not have given it another thought.\nLoewi's experiment gives some insight into using dreams to produce creative solutions. Nervous feelings are reduced during dreaming, which may be especially useful in solving problems that require a fresh point of view.\n Being able to take advantage of dreams for solving is improved if you \"set\" yourself before sleeping. Before you go to bed, try to think intently about a problem you wish to solve. Bury yourself in the problem by stating it clearly and reviewing all relevant information. Then use the suggestions listed in the previous section to catch your dreams. Although this method is not guaranteed to produce an original solution or a new insight, it is certain to be an adventure. About half of a group of college students using the method for a week recalled a dream that helped them solve a personal problem.www.ks5u.com",

            "article": "What does the future hold for the problem of housing? A good deal depends, of course, on the meaning of \"future\". If one is thinking in terms of science fiction and the space age, it is at least possible to assume that man will have solved such trivial and earthly problems as housing. Writers of science fiction, from H.G. Wells onwards, have had little to say on the subject. They have conveyed the suggestion that men will live in great comfort, with every imaginable apparatus  to make life smooth, healthy and easy, if not happy. But they have not said what his house will be made of. Perhaps some new building material, as yet unimagined, will have been discovered or invented at least. One may be certain that bricks and mortar(,) will long have gone out of fashion.\nBut the problems of the next generation or two can more readily be imagined. Scientists have already pointed out that unless something is done either to restrict the world's rapid growth in population or to discover and develop new sources of food (or both), millions of people will be dying of starvation or at the best suffering from underfeeding before this century is out. But nobody has yet worked out any plan for housing these growing populations. Admittedly the worst situations will occur in the hottest parts of the world, where housing can be light structure or in backward areas where standards are traditionally low. But even the minimum shelter requires materials of some kind and in the teeming, bulging towns the low-standard \"housing\" of flattened petrol cans and dirty canvas is far more wasteful of ground space than can be tolerated.\nSince the war, Hong Kong has suffered the kind of crisis which is likely to arise in many other places during the next generation. Literally millions of refugees arrived to swell the already growing population and emergency steps had to be taken rapidly to prevent squalor and disease and the spread crime. The city is tackling the situation energetically and enormous blocks of tenements are rising at an astonishing aped. But Hong Kong is only one small part of what will certainly become a vast problem and not merely a housing problem, because when population grows at this rate there are accompanying problems of education, transport, hospital services, drainage, water supply and so on. Not every area may give the same resources as Hong Kong to draw upon and the search for quicker and cheaper methods of construction must never stop.",

Boys and girls have nearly two months' holiday before them as they leave school by train and car to return home to their fathers and mothers.\nThe summer holidays are the best part of the year for most children. The weather is usually good, so that one can spend most of one's time playing in the garden or, if one lives in the country, out in the woods and fields. Even if one lives in a big town, one can usually go to a park to play.\nThe best place for a summer holiday, however, is the seaside. Some children are lucky enough to live near the sea, but for the others who do not, a week or two at one of the big seaside towns is something that they will talk about for the whole of the following year.\nIn England, it is not only the rich who can take their children to the seaside; if a factory worker or a bus driver, a street cleaner or a waiter wants to take his wife and children to Southend or Margate, Blackpoor or Clacton, he is usually quite able to do so.\nNow, what is it that children like so much about the seaside? I think it is the sand, sea and sun more than any other things. Of course, there are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat, and exciting things to do, but it is the feeling of sand under one's feet, of salt water on one's skin, and of the warm sun on one's back that make the seaside what it is.",

So it?s time for him to come back to China and join a program to try to increase the panda population.\nThe National Zoo has tried to breed Mei Xiang a few times since Tai Shan was born, without success.

This isn't because people feel thankful for the cold weather, nor because the important festivals---Christmas or Spring Festival---offer an excuse to celebrate. In fact, \"Bless you!\" is a common response if someone sneezes, a symptom of catching a cold or the flu.\nColds and the flu are the most common illnesses of autumn and winter as the weather gets colder. Viruses cause them. If you get one you will feel annoyed, but it is not usually serious. The flu is spread from person to person when we come into contact with a person with the virus. We get the virus on our hands and then we touch our noses and our mouths. We can pass on the flu before we realize we have it. You can infect  others one day before symptoms develop and for up to five days after becoming sick.\nGetting a flu vaccination is the best way to prevent the illness. Even if your body has built up antibodies for one kind of flu. The vaccine is only effective for one year and viruses are different from year to year, so it is necessary to get a flu vaccination every year. The best time to get the vaccination is October or November. Besides, there are other ways to reduce your chance of getting a flu. Wash your hands. Get enough rest. Eat garlic regularly. Don't let stress control you. Exercise regularly.",

With this insurance, people can see a doctor when they are sick or hurt. \nThe program is not expensive at all, but many people are still not enrolling   in it. People say that it still costs too much money. They need all of their money to pay for things like food and rent  .\nIt would be great if everyone could have health insurance. People are working hard to come up with ways to make this happen. One idea is to make the Healthy Families Program free for some people.\nIt is important for people to see a doctor when they need to.

Hopefully some of them will allow even more families to get health insurance.\nThe Healthy Families Program is made to help those who don't have welfare   and cannot earn enough to pay for private health insurance.

I like English and physics, because they're interesting. I don't like math. It's too boring. At noon, I have to have lunch at school because my home is far from my school. We usually have two classes in the afternoon--art and politics. We finish our classes at 3:30 p. m. After school, my friends and I always play football on the playground. And then we go home by bus.\nOn weekends, we have no classes. We often go to the park and sometimes we go to the movies in the evening. We see movies twice a month. I like some famous  actors like Jackie Chan.\nOh, I have no time to write more. Please write back soon.\nBest wishes,\nWang Gang\n,.",

            "article": "You could feel sorry for Alberto Torres, who is blind. The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. \"Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,\" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. \"We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,\" said the hospital's director.\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. \"If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there.\" he said. \"I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary,\" insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task.",

It is also known as kiteboarding, and in some European countries as flysurfing. Kitesurfing works through wind power  by using a large kite to pull a rider on the water at high speed.\nAt first, kitesurfing was a difficult and dangerous sport. Now it is becoming easier and safer because of the safer kite design. For an able and strong person, kitesurfing can be a very fun, extremely exciting sport, just like skating on the water with a feeling of flying. It has become more and more popular.\nCompared with other water sports, kitesurfing is easier to learn. A beginner can understand how to operate the kite with 5--10 hours of training. And anybody aged from 13 to 65 can learn. It is not expensive to get the equipment for kitesurfing, which costs $1,000 to 82,500. Training lessons _ from $200 to $500 for two or three hours. With the development of its equipment progress, kitesurfing is becoming even safer. After some training, you can enjoy its excitement and challenging feeling.\nWith the rising popularity of kitesurfing, most major seaside cities have kitesurfing clubs. In China, Xiamen is the only place that has the kitesurfing club, which provides professional kitesurfing training and equipments.",

            "article": "\"Humans have a code of ethics  ,\" says Marc Bekoff, an animal behavior expert at the University of Colorado. \" If I don't play in a certain way, you won't play with me. Some animals have the same code.\"\n     Scientists recently discovered that animals that live in groups, such as elephants, foxes, and wolves, are especially likely to follow rules. If they don't, and each does its own thing, the group might break apart. Group members would be forced to live alone. Then they'd have a harder time hunting and raising their young.\n    That's probably why a traveling wolf pack stopped and waited to let its slowly moving leader catch up. Similar social ties may have caused a captive elephant to save her friend from drowning. Selfish reasons certainly motivated the male fox, who wanted to keep playing.\nSometimes, though, animals go out of their way to do what's right, even when there's nothing in it for them. Nobody knows why. \" It might simply feel good to be kind, just as it does for humans,\"  says Bekoff.\n     If your friend wasn't nice to you, what would you do? Maybe you would just walk away. That's exactly what a wild red fox did when she was play-boxing with another fox. The larger fox, a male, began pushing too hard. The little female didn't like fighting. She ran away quickly.\n     \" He still wanted to play,\" says Marc Bekoff. So the male fox ran after his playmate, bowed down, and rolled over. His body language meant, \" Don't leave, I'll play nicely.\" The female gave him another chance, and the male wrestled more gently this time.",

And why do we want to act as if they must be true? In an age long before the Internet, a young American at a party found himself seated next to the famous Chinese diplomat Wellington Koo.Completely not knowing what to say to someone from such a different culture, this young man turned and asked, \"Likee soupee?\" After all, he assumed, don't all Chinese speak in broken English? Mr.Koo smiled and nodded.Later when called upon to speak, Wellington Koo delivered a wonderful talk in fluent English, sat down while the applause was still continuing, turned to the young man and whispered, \"Likee speechee?\"\nDo you know why red roses are so popular? Men keep buying them.They assume that all women prefer red roses.But when women are asked what color1 of rose is their favorite, they are more likely to answer that they prefer yellow, white or peach.And when asked what kind of flowers they would prefer to receive, the answer is generally not roses at all.The age-old assumption that most women like red roses best is simply not true.\nWe all make assumptions.They're too often wrong and can easily get us into trouble.So here is what I've learned: when in doubt, check it out.And if I'm not in doubt, I still check it out.We may think we know.But what we know may not be so.So it's best to check it out.",

In the Three Kingdoms Period, Lu Su, General of Wu State, trained his soldiers here.\nIn 716, Kaiyuan of Tang Dynasty, General Zhang Shuo was sent to defend at Yuezhou and he rebuilt it into a tower named South Tower, and then Yueyang Tower. In 1044, Song Dynasty, Teng Zijing was stationed at Baling Jun, the ancient name of Yueyang City. In the second year, he had the Yueyang Tower repaired and had poems by famous poets written on the walls of the tower. Fan Zhongyan, a great artist and poet, was invited to write the well-known poem about Yueyang Tower. In his A Panegyric of the Yueyang Tower (<<>> ), Fan writes: \"Be the first to worry about the troubles across the land, the last to enjoy universal happiness.\" His words have been well-known for thousands of years and made the tower even better known than before.\nThe style of Yueyang Tower is quite special. The main tower is 21.35 meters high with 3 stories, flying eave   and wood construction, the helmet-roof of such a large size is a rarity   among the ancient architectures in China.\nEntering the tower, you'll see \"Dongting is the water of the world, Yueyang is the tower of the world\". Moving on, there is a platform that once used as the training ground for the navy of Three-Kingdom Period general Lu Su. To its south is the Huaifu Pavilion  in honor of Du Fu. Stepping out of the Xiaoxiang Door, the Xianmei Pavilion and the Sanzui Pavilion can be seen standing on two sides. In the garden to the north of the tower is the tomb of Xiaoqiao, the wife of Zhou Yu.",

A microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically much smaller, in both actual size and aggregate file size. Microblogs \"allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links\".\nAs with traditional blogging, microbloggers post about topics ranging from the simple, such as \"what I'm doing right now,\" to the thematic , such as \"sports cars.\" Commercial microblogs also exist, to promote   websites, services and/or products, and to promote collaboration within an organization.\nSome microblogging services offer features such as privacy settings, which allow users to control who can read their microblogs, or other ways of publishing rights besides entering the web-based interface.  These may include text messaging, E-mail, or digital audio.\nThe first microblogs were known as tumblelogs. The term was invented in a blog post on April 12, 2005. However, by 2006 and 2007, the term microblog came into greater usage for such services provided by Tumbler and Twitter. Other leading social networking websites Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, and XING also have their own microblogging features, better known as status updates.\nSeveral studies, especially by Harvard Business School have tried to analyze the usage behavior of Microblogging services. Many of these studies show that for services such as Twitter, there is a small group of active users contributing to most of the activity.\nTwitter, Facebook and other microblogging services are also becoming a platform for marketing and public relations, with a sharp growth in the number of social media marketers. The Sysomos study shows that this specific group of marketers on Twitter is much more active than general user population, with 15% following more than 2,000 people.",

They should also have experience in the business they propose to enter, and offer well-prepared business plans that show the ability to repay the loans. If you are not such a person, then you need to double your preparations to convince the banker to lend you that much needed start-up capital . If your business is new and small, bankers will need to know as much as possible about you and your business.\nHowever, many small business owners often make the mistake of not being well prepared when going to the bank to apply for the loan. Surprisingly, many loan applicants don't even have the slightest idea how or when they intend to repay the money they request. Often they don't even know how much money they need. When asked how much money they want to borrow, many people give these two common responses: \"How much money can I get?\" and \"As much as possible.\" Is it any wonder that lenders say no?\nSo the most important thing is do your homework before you ask for a loan.",

While we were there, we walked a lot. First, we went to see all the famous sites--Big Ben, Piccadilly Circus, Buckingham Palace, then we went shopping in Oxford Street. On the last morning my friends stayed in bed late, but I got up early and went to Camden Market. You can buy all kinds of jewelry and clothes there, and I bought a silver ring for my sister. It was really hot in the afternoon, so we went to Hyde Park for a game of football.

We were living in College Station, Texas and my wife and I were on our way home from Houston, Texas one Sunday morning. We decided to stop at a local gas station to get something to eat since we had enough time.\nWhen we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as if he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something to drink. However, it was not this that moved  me.\nA dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog lover, I noticed that the dog was a mother and that she had just had some puppies . She was hungry and weak and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not live on.\nPeople walking by didn't even notice her. She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still deserved  better. But we still did not do anything, someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went back into a store and bought dog food with all the money he had.\nI know that this story isn't as inspirational as most stories, but it plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend. And a lot of people forget that some animals are parents too.",

She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print. The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work. We relaxed, smiled, joked. There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague. Enough sorrow had been shed already. We needed a break.",

Try to keep a low profile in your neighborhood: don't announce to just about everyone that you are running a home business with thousands of dollars worth of equipment. As much as possible, don't invite clients or visitors to your home. In fact I know of some home-based entrepreneurs who would rather meet their clients in a neutral ground, e.g. the client's office or even Starbucks.\n    There are other ways to keep burglars away from your house.\n    *Keep lights on around your house in the evenings. Light is a natural fright for burglars.\n*Invest in a security alarm, particularly if your house is located in a remote spot. Security systems can often bring down the cost of your homeowner's insurance premiums .\n*Make sure that all windows and doors are locked and the security alarm turned on before you sleep at night or go out of the house. Avoid keeping house keys in obvious places, such as under the lamp or top of the doorframe.\n*Adding an additional lock will provide extra security when you are home. The dead-lock, sometimes called an \"exit-only deadbolt\" is an deadbolt that doesn't have an external key. It's clearly visible on the door from the outside, but can't be broken into without destroying the door, frame, or lock itself. While the security won't help directly when you aren't home, the visibility may discourage an  _ from trying the door.\n*Your door itself should be made of strong materials, such as one-inch thick solid hardwood or heavy metal.",

You can talk to friends who have traveled to the places, you can go and see a colour film about them, or you can read a travel book.\nIt seems that there are three kinds of travel books. The first are those that give a personal, subjective  idea of travels which their writer has got himself. These books can be useful if the writers share their traveling experiences with others. The second kind are those books which give objective  information of things to be done and seen. If _ has written such a book about the facts of a place, then it is more useful. The third kind are those books which are called \"a guide\" to some place or other. If they are good, they will describe and explain the place in detail. Like the first kind , they can be interesting and exciting, but their main purpose is to help the reader plan his travel in the most practical way.\nWhatever kind of travel book you choose, you must make sure that the book does not describe everything as interesting, exciting or fantastic. You must also keep an open eyes on its date of publication  because travel is very practical matter and many things change quickly in the 21st century. Finally, you should make sure that it's easy to find the useful information for you travel.",

Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game.\n\"People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship,\" said social worker Ken Yip, \"and this is what is causing a lot of family problems.\" When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply.\nThere are people who wish to remain anonymous  for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he doesn't want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime.\nName or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter of responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our name that we honor what we say.",

A part-time job can teach teenagers important skills like responsibility , independence ,teamwork and leadership.\nYoung people can expand  their social circles beyond their classmates by making friends with co-workers. And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting , and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job. Still, many American teenagers value their work experience and the skills they gain on the job.",

But do you know it owes a great deal to Marits, Einstein's former wife?\nIn 1896, 17-year-old Einstein went to Zurich to study physics. There he met a girl from Hungary. They studied in the same class. The same interest brought the two together and the young man fell in love with Marits. In 1903, when Einstein was 24 years old, he married Marits, who was 4 years older than he.\nAfter their marriage, Einstein devoted himself to the research of the great theory. To give her husband more help, Marits gave up her own work, and became a good wife and assistant. She tried her best to encourage him whenever possible and she was sure that her husband would succeed. They often discussed the theory while walking outside or sitting together in the room. They even discussed it in their letters when one of them was away from home.\nIn 1914, the Einstein moved to Berlin and settled there. At that time, Einstein's theory proved to be correct and he had become famous all over the world. Marits was very proud of him and his success. But it was not long before the First World War broke out. Marits as well as her two sons, who were all on holidays in Switzerland, couldn't come back to Berlin. The war not only stopped Einstein's work but broke up the warm, happy family. In 1919, Einstein and Marits had to get divorced.\nEinstein himself, however, later said that Marits was really an outstanding woman.",

The Isle of Wight is one of the main tourist attractions. Here is some information on a few of the attractions on the IOW.\nDinosaur Isle\nIt is located in Sandown, a seaside town on the southeast coast. It's a large, lovely museum, both fun and educational. Here you can see a large fossil collection of all kinds of dinosaurs, as well as a gift shop. You can walk into the past and then the future, learning about the history and the development of the civilization of dinosaurs that lived 120 million years ago.\nRobin Hill Country Park\nThe park is in the beautiful countryside, and is suitable for children's parties and games. It has five new gardens, and offers great opportunities to see and take pictures of the rare red squirrels.\nThe West of the Wight\nHere we have the Marine Aquarium, the Archaeology Exhibition and the Model Railway. They offer another opportunity to combine fun with learning. This is a great place to see ancient boats crossing the narrow strait between the island and the mainland.\nThe Wight Bus Museum\nThis museum is run completely by unpaid volunteers. It has a bus collection stored in what was once a warehouse . Most of the buses in the museum date back to around the 1910's.\nWith all of these choices, what are you waiting for? IOW Tourism welcomes you!",

Now scientists say, it's a little bug that causes obesity .\n    As the holiday season with its abundant feasting arrives, millions of food lovers are keeping an eye on their figures. But scientists have found that weight gain is not about too much Christmas\nturkey or hot chocolates, but some bacteria in your guts .\n    Chinese scientists recently discovered a type ofbacteria in guts that may be to blame for obesity.\n    A research team led by Zhao Liping, a professor in Shanghai, has identified a precise link\nbetween a particular kind ofbacteria and unusual weight gain.\n    \"The endotoxin  released by the bacterium can activate  a gene that helps produce fat. And it also deactivates a gene that consumes fat,\" Zhao says.\n    Scientists have long believed that microscopic organisms in the gut, microbiota, may play a very important role in weight gain, but they had never been able to prove it.\n    In 2004, American microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon and his colleagues discovered a general link between obesity and gut microbiota in mice.\n    While a link was believed to exist, proving it was another matter.\n    \"The list of diseases that they may play a role in is just growing and growing,\" says Lita Proctor, director of the US National Institutes of Health. \"But the problem is that we're only able to look at associations and aren't yet able to conduct cause-and-effect studies.\"\n     In the clinical study, researchers found a growth of too much endotoxin-producing bacteria,\nleading t0 35 percent ofthe gut bacteria, in an obese patient whose initial weight was 175 kg.\n     Based on this information, researchers tried to cure the patient by feeding him a specialized\nnutritional liquid food to decrease the bacteria in his guts to ignorable amounts.\n     After 23 weeks, the patient lost 51.4 kg, with his fatty liver disease having almost disappeared.",

It is well-known for its clubs, its fashion and its music, not to mention its world -famous football team, Manchester United.\nThere is plenty to see in Manchester and something to suit all taste. For example, you have a taste of the Orient in Chinatown, home to Manchester's large Chinese population. Another place to visit is the historical Eastlefield area, which contains the first urban heritage park in Britain. Here you can walk around the museums and experience the atmosphere of the 19thcentury Manchester.\nFootball fans need not feel left out; they can always make a trip to the Old Trafford  Manchester United Museum which also contains a coffee shop and a souvenir shop\nIt's easy to find your way around the city center and you're never too far away from a bus, which will take you wherever you want to go.

There's a wide variety of homely and old-fashioned ones\nWhatever you do, you won't have a dull moment in the place which was awarded the title of \"most interesting city in Europe \".

She told us, \"Daniel is so full of curiosity  .\" At that moment, we hear a loud noise and then silence. We go upstairs and find Daniel getting out of a wardrobe which he has pulled over onto the floor, with a book in his hand. \"It's for you, Mum,\" he says and looks up at his mum and smiles. Seven-year-old Daniel has a lovely face. He has golden hair, big brown eyes, and a friendly smile. I have to admit that Daniel doesn't look like a naughty boy.\n      Angela told me all about it, \"Once I found him as he was about to put Jasper in the washing machine.\" Jasper, she explained, is the Browns' dog. \"When I asked him why, he said that he thought Jasper was dirty! It's amazing how one little boy can cause so much trouble. Another time he cut off all the hair of the little girl next door. She was going to attend her sister's wedding and the neighbors haven't spoken to us since.\"\n      Angela told me about Daniel's most expensive crime. \"I was about to do the washing up when the baby started crying. Daniel decided to help and filled the kitchen sink with water. When I came in, the water was already flooding the kitchen and was about to flood the hall. The carpet was ruined and had to be replaced. I hope things will get better as he gets older.\"\n      Amazingly, Daniel is quite well behaved in school. This may be because he is seldom bored.

They created the viruses just to show their intelligence . These kinds of computer viruses are named Jerusalem Viruses. These viruses can stay in computers for a long time. When the time comes they will attack the computers by lowering the functions , damaging their normal programs or even getting rid of all the information.\nWe now come to know that Jerusalem Viruses often attack computers on Fridays and that they are spreading to a lot of computers.

I have cerebral palsy. I just want one day when no one laughs at me or makes fun of me.\nLove,\nAmy\nAt radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. When Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully.  He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper.\nThe next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the \"News Sentinel\". The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television stations reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable, Christmas gift--just one day without teasing.\nSuddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other.\nMany people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high.\nAmy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at  South Wayne High School. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel.\nThat year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city. The mayor explained that by daring to make such a simple wish, Amy taught a universal lesson. \"Everyone, \"said the mayor, \"wants and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity and warmth. \"",

This is not a small effect.\"\nInstead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nSome possible benefits seemed highly speculative, the researchers conceded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung , charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\"Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,\" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found. But if people also drove less and walked or biked more, those extra saved years would soar to more than 7,300 years in London and 12,500 years in Delhi because of less heart disease.",

While in school, sometimes you are tired of your lessons, but have you ever noticed the happy smile on your teacher's face when you did a good job?\nOne day it is fine. Just before you want to go out, it suddenly starts to rain . Maybe you would feel very sad and start complaining about the weather.

And with the timely rain , crops in the fields will grow better and better and farmers will have a good harvest.\nAlthough everyone wants to succeed in what he tries to do, sometimes failure can't be avoided . I think failure is not terrible, and the terrible thing is that we are afraid of it and give up hope .\nWhen we face failure , we must be confident in ourselves, draw a useful lesson from it and try our best to finish what we have to do.

Maybe you died or someone you know did.Or maybe you were back in high school.These are among the most common dreams people have and they all mean something.Here are some of the most common dreams and their interpretations or symbolism.\nDreams of flying.Dreams of flying represent feelings of freedom that may result from an instance when you overcome a limitation or obstacle.Usually, children have more flying dreams than adults, because children are more open to their possibilities, and adults have often accepted limitations imposed by society.\nTeeth falling out.Food in a dream is symbolic of knowledge because food nourishes the physical body and knowledge nourishes the soul.Teeth are a means to break down food or knowledge.When your teeth fall out in a dream, it could signify that you feel ill - equipped to break down the knowledge that you have available, that the way you break things down has changed.That change can be either positive or negative.\nHigh school dreams.High school is a place of learning from the past, and dreaming of being unprepared for a high school test can indicate a struggle to access information you need to handle in your life.\nRecurring dreams and nightmares.Recurring dreams are your subconscious  mind's way of trying to get your attention.A recurring dream is a step down from a nightmare that is a louder, more insistent way your subconscious mind communicates.If you have a recurring dream, try to stop in the dream and _ what the dream is trying to tell you.That could mean asking someone who is chasing you what he or she wants.A woman dreamed for years that an old, haggard woman was chasing her around her home.When she finally stopped in the dream and asked the old woman what she represented, the old woman suddenly turned into a beautiful young woman and replied, \"I represent your question of ' what if?' \"",

When the rain stopped, people found that a dog swam to an island in the river twice a day for two weeks. Why did she do so? Her four children were there. The mother swam there every day to feed her babies. This true story moved many people.\nAnother story is about chimpanzees . A scientist named Jane Goodall spent 4 years living with chimpanzees in Africa. She found that chimpanzees also cared for those that were hurt or got lost. \"It is not only humans who have duties, animals also do,\" she said.\nTwo birds in Chengdu also showed their parental  love. Their baby was hurt and fell on the street in the center of the city. Cars were driving past but the brave parents rushed down to the road and took the little bird away with their claws .",

He thought he knew what the he wanted. He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile.

It is difficult and dangerous to clear these rnines, About 50  people including many children were' killed 'or htirt each iay.  In 2003,  APOPO,  a Dutch research com pan y that uains the an imals, came up with the-idea of s\\ng rats to search for the mines.\nThe animal trainers 'found that a kind of rats from Africa were clever and had.a sharp*  sense of smell.  The rats were about 75 cm long and.weighed about l.35 kg, light enough to run across a minefield without setting off the mines.\nIn January 2004, the APOPO started this project. First, the trainers let the 4-week-old baby rats get familiar with humans. A few weeks later, the rats were no Ionger afraid of people and 'the things around them. Then they were trained to connect a click* sound with food. After the rats had leamed that, the trainers then taught them to tell the difference between the smell of mines and other smells. When the rats could do it, the click was sounded and they were given a bit of banana.  The method was called clicker training. \"The training isn't easy, said trainer Abdullah Mchomvu.  \"You have to be patient. Sometimes I get angry, but then again, I tell myself these are animals.\"\nAfter nine months'training, the rats were taken to a minefield. They'ran across the minefield, stopped, sat and scratched the ground to tell the deminers*  that they smelt out'a mine.  Then the mine was cleared. It had  taken two 'deminers  a day to clear a 200m2 . minefield, but with the help of two rats 'they could finish it in two hours.\nThe rats and the deminers saved thousands of lives, \"The rats did this job much better than we expected. So far they have helped to make almost 2,000,000m2 of land safe. They are heroes,\" said Bart Weeqens, the head of the APOPO.",

You don't need to worry about people who have beautiful houses with large gardens and swimming pools or those who have nice cars and a lot of money and so on. Why? Because those who have big houses may often feel lonely and those who have cars may want to walk on the country roads in their free time.\nIn fact, happiness is always around you if you put your heart into it. When you are in trouble at school, your friends will help you; when you are studying hard at your lessons, your parents are always taking good care of you; When you get success, your friends will say congratulations to you; When you do something wrong, people around you will help you to correct it. All your happiness is always around you.\nHappiness is not the same as money. It is a feeling of your heart. When you are poor, you can also say you are very happy, because you have something else that can't be bought with money. When you meet with difficulties, you can say loudly you are very happy, because you have more chances to challenge yourself. So you should not always say you are poor and you have bad luck. As the saying goes, life is like a revolving  door. When it closes, it also opens. If you take every chance you get, you can be a happy and lucky person.\n,. (5,2,10)",

            "article": "\"No man is an island\" is a well-known line from John Donne's Devotion. It was written more than three hundred years ago. Even now people still agree with him. No one can live a completely lonely life. Without other people, life will become empty and sad. We all need to have friends.\nFor some of us, although making friends is not difficult, feeling shy, we may not want to make the first move. It is also difficult at times to keep the friends we already have.\nThere are many books about friendship, but Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, written in 1936, is the most famous. This \"how to\" book about getting along with other people became a best seller. It was later put into 28 languages.\nDale Carnegie's advice seems to be simple, but can his advice help you? Do you need to change the way you act? Here is the list of advice from his book:\nBe friendly and polite.\nAlways greet with a smile. Begin with \"Excuse me\" or \"Would you please\" when you want to ask somebody. Remember to say \"Thank you\" and try to be as helpful as you can.\nGo out of your way to be nice.\nFind some time to do special things for other people. Making some soup for a sick neighbour may seem like a little thing to you, but it will make your neighbor feel a lot better.\nRemember names.\nThey say that the sweetest music to a person's ears is the sound of his or her own name.\nBe open-minded.\nTry to understand other people's ways and ideas and learn something from them.\nListen patiently.\nWhen someone is talking to you, look at him or her, listen carefully and say something when necessary.",

When the office employee of the garage was writing up the bill,she noticed my Louisiana license plate. \"You from New Orleans?\"she asked I said I was, \"No charge.\"She said, and firmly shook her head when I reached for my wallet. The next day I went for a haircut, and the same thing happened.\nAs my wife was studying in Florida, we decided to move there and tried to find a rental house that we could afford while also paying off a mortgage (> on our mined house. We looked at many places, but none was satisfactory. We'd began to accept that we*d have to live in extremely reduced circumstances for a while, when I got a very curious e-mail from a James Kemmedy in California. He'd read some pieces I'd written about our sufferings for State, the online magazine  and wanted to give us (\"\"no conditions attached')a new house across thelake from New Orleans.\nIt sounded too good to be true, but I replied, thanking him for his exceptional generosity, that we had no plan to go back. Then a poet at the University of Florida offered to let his house to me, while he went to England on his one-year paid leave. The rent was rather reasonable. I mentioned the poet's offer to James Kemdedy, and the next day he sent a check covering our entire rent for eight months.\nThroughout this painful experience, the kindness of strangers has done much to bring back my faith in humanity. It's almost worth losing your worldly possessions to be reminded that people are really nice when given half a chance.",

She was thinking that she must tell her daily maid the next morning to lock the door, and then she remembered that she had gone shopping after the maid had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks. She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. Looking into the living room she saw a sight of confusion over by her writing desk. It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced into the house during her absence. Her first thought was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more reasonable to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the doorman from his basement .By this time her legs were beginning to shake, so she sat down and accepted a cup of a very strong tea, while she telephoned to the police. Then her sense regained, she was ready to set off with the doorman's help to search for any thieves who might still be hiding in her flat.",

When a signal is given twice, it is an answer to a call for help.\nIf you don't think that you will get help before night comes, try to make a little house and cover up the holes with branches with lots of leaves and grass.

            "article": "Conventional wisdom is a major barrier to innovation that threatens the survival of companies everywhere.It's based on the assumption that old ideas will always work,so they shouldn't be challenged. While this may be a valid assumption in situations that don't change,it's unlikely to hold true in a changing situation.In today's rapid changing global environment,old methods often don't work,and stubbornly using them can lead to major problems.\nMost people seem to agree with conventional wisdom because it gives one a false sense of security.If everyone else believes it,then it must be true.Individuals who use conventional wisdom are certain that they are right,and being right is good. They want to continue using old ideas rather than take risks with changes that might not work.In 1977,Ken Olsen,co-founder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),stated \"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\" Despite being a dominant leader in the computer industry,DEC no longer exists.\nPeople seem to forget that since innovation is a change,there can be no innovation without change.Unfortunately,conventional wisdom prevents leaders,followers and companies from changing and therefore innovating.If companies don't innovate,but their competitors do,the future is likely to be problematic. Breaking from conventional wisdom has led to many of the most innovative companies and products in history across many industries,so it has a powerful effect on business success.\nTed Turner (founder of CNN) knew little,if anything,about the news business,but he knew it was inconvenient to watch news only at the dinner hour,as was common before CNN.Turner's solution was to create a cable channel dedicated to news 24 hours a day.The news establishment reflected conventional wisdom at the time,and predicted his idea would fail because no one wanted to watch the news all day.However,it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that viewers don't have to watch the news all day for the CNN to work.Viewers just have to watch when they want to get information.Due to conventional thinking,the critics failed to recognize the opportunity that was clear to Ted. They assumed that only what was familiar to them could work in the future.\nConventional wisdom prevents creativity,flexibility and risk-taking,so unconventional leaders enthusiastically break from it.To survive,thrive and maintain competitive advantage,companies must be flexible when reacting to change.",

            "article": "\"Family\" is of course an _ word. But when British people say that their society is based on family life, they are thinking of \"family\" in its narrow, peculiarly European sense of mother ,father and children living together alone in their own house as an economic and social unit. Thus, every British marriage indicates the beginning of a new and independent family--hence the tremendous importance of marriage in British life. For both the man and the woman, marriage means leaving one's parents and starting one's own life. The man's first duty will then be to his wife, and the wife's to her husband. He will be entirely responsible for her financial support, and she for the running of the new home. Their children will be their common responsibility and theirs alone. Neither the wife's parents nor the husband's, nor their brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, have any right to interfere with them--they are their own masters.\nReaders of novels like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice will know that in former times marriage among wealthy families were arranged by the girl's parents, that is, it was the parents' duty to find a suitable husband for their daughter, preferably a rich one, and by skillful encouragement to lead him eventually to ask their permission to marry her. Until that time, the girl was protected and maintained in the parents' home, and the financial relief of getting rid of her could be seen in their giving the newly married pair a sum of money called a dowry. It is very different today. Most girls of today get a job when they leave school and become financially independent before their marriage. This has had two results. A girl chooses her own husband, and she gets no dowry.",

And the signs are that this is beginning to happen in China.\nEmployers want people skilled,enthusiastic and devoted. So these are the qualities that any reasonably intelligent job applicants will try to show no matter what his or her actual feelings are. In response,employers are increasingly using questions which try and show the applicant's true personality.\nThe question in the first paragraph comes from a test called the Keirsey Personality Sorter. It is an attempt to discover how people solve problems,rather than what they know. This is often called an aptitude test  .\nAccording to Mark Baldwin, many job applicants in China are finding this type of questions difficult. When a Chinese person fills out an aptitude test, he or she will think there is a right answer and they may fail because they try to guess what the examiner wants to see.\nThis is sometimes called the prisoner's dilemma. Applicants are trying to act cleverly in their own interest. But they fail because they don't understand what the interviewer is looking for. Remember that in an aptitude test,the correct answer is always the honest answer.",

Most of them managed to get along fairly well, but one--Francis Blustering, who had been wounded and who never recovered his strength-- was unable to work like others. In time he became very poor. Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. \nOnce, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing.\nOne of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \"You refuse, then?\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \"Yes, I cannot allow it.\"\nOne by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home.\nA few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks   of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. \n\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\"\n\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly. \"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\"",

He was happy, and life was good.The business thrived until the great depression hit the entire country. No one had money to purchase pretty things or even food. In 1930, Marie had a heart attack and left Bernie alone. \n              Following Marie's death, which Bernie felt was brought about from worrying about the store, He lost interest in everything. He had few customers and did not make them feel welcome, Bernie wandered about the store , dusting a bit and sweeping the floor. His inventory remained almost the same, as nothing much was sold .A deep depressing set in. He had lost Marie , his true love , and now his business seemed lost as well, Why did he want to live ?\n              A few houses down the street lived a family who had also fallen on hard times. They seldom had three meals a day. Julie , the youngest girl, was fourteen . Julie worried about Mr. Mears' getting so thin. At meal time, she would take a portion of their meal to Bernie. She would stay and talk to him, dusting and cleaning . \n              After several months Bernie began to improve. He still had no customers to speak of, but from what he had left in the stor , he would sack a few cans to take to Julie's family. \n              In early spring, Julie saw her father planting a garden. This gave her an idea. She suggested Bernie making a garden in the big space beside the store, which they had once thought would become a parking lot , and sell the produce really cheap in the store. It would help the neighbors and also Bernie to have money for new merchandise. They would plant half the garden space now and half in three weeks giving them fresh produce for a long time . \n              Julie prayed hard as they placed the seeds in the ground. When the seeds sprouted, Julie looked anxiously at the rows and there were no empty spots. They all came up and produced the best crop of vegetables Bernie had ever seen. They soon became well-known in the community for having the best prices and finest produce in town . They also extended credit to their neighbors and accepted various items as trade for merchandise.\n              The two of them worked hard throughout the 1930s and made a very successful business. Julie earned a salary . As the economy picked up, so did sales at the store.",

In an animated movie, objects, such as ice cream and paper dolls, appear to be alive or moving.\nAnimated movies are made up of hundreds of pictures. It takes 15 pictures to make just one second of film. To make a movie that lasts one minute, students need to take about 900 frames. A frame is a picture.\nAnimation expert Joe Summerhays teaches kids the steps to shoot a movie. He says what they learn behind the scenes, however, also counts. Students create their films in small groups. They have to agree on every decision.\n \" The benefit of the class is less animation and more problem-solving,\" Summerhays said. \"It's all about teamwork.\"\nAbout 4,000 kids have made movies at the Jacob Burns Film Center.

Founded in 1863, just two years after Italy was united, Milan Polytechnic is international famous. Many of its graduates now work in big companies abroad like M.I.T., Caltech and Oxbridge.\nYet the Politechnic has a problem. As you know, here in Italy people speak Italian. Beautiful though the language may be, it is not a good choice for engineers when they're building a way in Norway or designing a bridge in Vietnam. For better or worse, the global tongue of engineers is English. Hoping to attract more international students, the Politechnic decided to run its doctor's courses in English only. Over 100 teachers went to court to block the plan, referring to a 1933 law that makes Italian the official language. For some teachers, all that matters is that they don't feel comfortable teaching in English. In 2013, the court said they were right. Teaching English was out.\nBut there was more to come. They then went on a nationwide campaign against their university's decision. Unwisely, the defenders of the Italian language backed them, saying, \"we note with regret and concern the ignorance and abandonment  of Italian in the university education.\"\nThe leaders at the Politechnic refused to be frightened, and asked for the ruling. Last month the Council of State said, \"Art and science are free, and teaching them is free.\" The question is whether teaching in English prevents students acquiring knowledge. But one could put it differently, and ask whether universities should be free to teach in whatever way they think best serves their students.\nInterestingly, the people one might expect to be most against English-only teaching, the students themselves, have taken it easy. The president, Giovanni Azzone, told me: \"Students write to me about everything from the lack of parking spaces to washrooms that don't work. Not one has ever complained about the courses in English.\"",

But the father, like a big tiger in a way, insisted gently, \"No, you must give him one of your favorite toys.\"\nAnd finally the boy, with his head down, picked up a toy he had just gotten. The father waited in the living room, and the boy walked to the front door with the toy in his hand. The father waited and waited.\nWhat do you think happened?\nAfter a couple of minutes, his son came running back into the living room, his face radiant  . \"Daddy,\" he said, \"can I do that again?\"\nI think I have got the answer to the question.",

Californians are feeling the heat after Governor Jerry Brown announced an order that puts mandatory  statewide water cutbacks into effect.\nCalifornia has faced water-use cutbacks in the past. In January 2014, Governor Brown called for residents to curb their water use by 20 percent, but many places around the state failed to meet that goal. This most recent announcement, however, marks the first time in the state's history that mandatory restrictions have been ordered.\nMost of California's water supply comes from the Sierra Nevada mountain range snowpack. Normally, during the spring and summer, this snow melts and puts new supplies into groundwater. but this past winter, the snowpack reached its lowest point since 1950. \"today we are standing on dry grass where there should be feet of snow\" announced Governor Brown.\nAs part of his order, Governor Brown called upon the state Water Resource Control Board to draft emergency rules for water use in the coming month. Cities and towns across the state must cut water usage by 25 percent. If city water agencies fail to meet these targets for water conservation, they could be fined $10,000 a day.\nThe state will also support local governments in replacing 50 million square feet of lawns with drought-tolerant plants that use less water. Outdoor lawn watering will be limited to two days per week, and residents will not be permitted to water their lawns during rainstorms and for two days afterwards. The order also asks local water agencies to raise the price of water to discourage excessive water use.\nGovernor Brown said change may not be easy, but it's necessary to ensure that residents can fill their water glasses into the future. \"it is a wake-up call,\" he said. \"it's requiring action and changes in behavior.\"",

            "article": "College visits are important.Before you commit years of your life and money to a school, be sure you're choosing a place,\" that is a good match for your personality and interests.You can't get the \"feel' of a school from any guidebook, so be sure to visit the campus.Below are a few tips for getting the most out of your college visit.\n1.Explore on your own\nOf course you should take the official campus tour, but be sure to allow time to hang around on your own. The trained tour guides will show you a school's selling points.But the 1dest and prettiest buildings don't give you the entire picture of a college.Try to walk the extra mile and get the complete picture of the campus.\n2.Read the Bulletin Boards\nWhen you visit the student center, academic buildings and residence hall, take a few minutes to read the bulletin boards.They provide an easy way to see what's happening on campus.The ads for lectures, clubs and plays can tell you what's going on outside the classrooms.\n3.Eat in the Dining Hall\nYou can get a good feel for student life by eating in the dining hall.Try to sit with students if you can.Do the students seem happy or stressed? Also, is the food good? Are there adequate healthy options? Many admission offices will give prospective students coupons for free meals in the dining halls.\n4.Visit a Class in Your Major\nIf you know what you want to study, a class visit makes a lot of sense.You'll get to observe other students in your field and see how involved they are  in classroom discussion.Try to stay after class for a few minutes and chat with the students to get their impressions of their professors and major.Be sure to call in advance to schedule a classroom visit--most colleges don't allow visitors to drop in on class unannounced.\n5.Talk to Lots of Students\nYour campus tour guide has been trained to market the sch001.Try to talk to students who aren't getting paid to impress you.These important conversations can often provide you with information about co1lege life that isn't part of the admission script.Few university officials wi11 tell you if their students spend all weekend drinking or studying, but a group of random(,) students might.\nFor more tips,please go to collegeapps.about.com.",

            "article": "Recently educators have been questioning \"prep school\" (=preparatory school)   where barely literate   high school athletes get their transcripts   by taking courses occasionally and sometimes by taking no courses at all. The athletes then go on to famous sports universities, where they exhaust their playing years before landing back on the streets without job opportunity or college degrees.\nThe prep school scheme was meant to avoid academic qualification rules for college athletes made years ago by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A., which was slow to recognize the seriousness of the problem, has finally adopted policies to root it out. But those policies will not do the job unless everyone is involved, including prep schools and college athletics departments that still recruit   students who do not meet academic standard.\nThe prep school scheme sends a dangerous message to poor neighborhoods, where young people too often ignore their studies, believing that they will magically become millionaires once the world sees their athletic talents. Even worse, it encourages students to drop out of traditional schools before graduation--at which point their grade-point averages would be written in stone--to sign up with fake schools that can help them rewrite their academic records.\nThe N.C.A.A. has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some. The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average, transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term.\nThese measures are encouraging as far as they go. But the N.C.A.A. will need to go much deeper into the problem if it hopes to break this scheme. For starters, it needs to make clear not just what courses high school athletes need to take to become qualified for college sports, but when they should take them. Until that happens, those who recruit young athletes will always be tempted to make fake academic record at the last possible moment for them.",

We have been killing animals for their fur, feathers or meat, or simply because they are dangerous. As a result, many kinds of animals have disappeared forever. Hundreds more are on the endangered list today.\nShould we care about animals? Of course we should. If animals of a certain kind all disappear, they will never come back again. Animals are more than just resources of things we need. Every kind of animal has its place in the balance of nature. Destroying any kind of animal can lead to many problems. For example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks, the corn and grain that the farmers stored were destroyed by rats and mice. Why?  Because hawks eat rats and mice. With less and less hawks to keep down their numbers, rats and mice multiplied quickly. And if people kill too many birds, more and more insects will eat the crops.\nLuckily, we've realized that we shouldn't kill animals any more. And people are working hard to save those animals that would disappear soon. The government also passed laws to protect the endangered animals. In fact, quite a few countries have passed such laws. These laws forbid the killing of any kind of animal on the endangered list. We should try our best to protect and save the endangered animals.",

            "article": "We've all felt discouragement at one point or another in our lives. However, when this emotion bleeds into other aspects of our life, it can sometimes be inappropriate or even harmful.\nI was personally discouraged by an adult during my high school. After telling her what university I wanted to attend, she plainly told me I would not get in. I was completely shocked and angry at her statement. The adult may have not intended to hurt me with her words, but it had an after effect. The meeting made me think she had no belief that I could possibly succeed in the future. After that it caused me to try to avoid any future meeting with adults until absolutely necessary.\nWe are all human; therefore, we can all understand that some days are more challenging. But when people allow situations of stress to consume  them, they cannot perform their best. People should pay attention to how their reactions could affect the person they are interacting with. People have the potential to perform their best when they _ the task at hand, but adults who come off in a rude and aggressive way through communication have an effect on teenagers' mind.\nAdults whether in schools, or any other institutions should work to tear down walls gently and create a safe space for the person they are serving. These adults should also help and contribute to a person's academic, personal and professional growth. High school is an important time when young people need someone to believe in them.\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that it is not completely up to adults only. Students are responsible for seeking help from adults who are in authority  positions. They are also responsible for the way they approach adults in their academic surroundings. Students can expect to be treated in a respectful way when they express at the beginning. Generally the responsibility lies on both parties. When both sides can communicate in a polite manner then the complete environment of the school has the potential to develop well.",

            "article": "Throughout July 1945, the Japanese mainland, from Tokyo on Honshu northward to the coast of Hokkaido, were bombed as if an invasion were about to take place. In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling Stalin at Potsdam. \nIn 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany's advances in development of the atomic bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S. president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan's unsatisfactory reply to the Allies' Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.\nOn August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion's immediate neighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000 others. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles.",

In one of the most extensive reports on college drinking thus far, a 1997 Harvard School of Public Health study found that 43 percent of college students admitted binge drinking in the preceding two weeks (Defined as four drinks in a sitting for a woman and five of a man, a drinking binge is when one drinks enough to risk health and well - being )\nExperts estimate that excessive drinking is involved in thousands of student deaths a year. And the Harvard researchers found that there has been a dramatic change in why students drink. 39 percent drank \"to get drunk\" in 1993, but 52 percent had the same objective in 1997.\n\"What has changed is the across - the - board acceptability of intoxication  ,\" says Felix Savino at UW - Madison. Many college students today see not just drinking but being drunk as their primary way of socializing.\nThe reasons for the shift are complex and not fully understood. But researchers guess that it may have something to do with today's instant - satisfaction life - style--and young people tend to take into the extreme.\nWhile binge drinking isn't always deadly, it does have other, wide - ranging effects. Academics is one area where it takes a heavy  _ (something paid, lost or suffered). Perhaps because alcohol increases aggression and affects judgement, it is also related to 25 percent of violent crimes and roughly 60 percent of vandalism on campus.

Then, during the first period, teachers call in orders on their room phones, and students make deliveries. By closing time at 9.20 a.m., the shop usually sells 90 drinks.\n\"Whoever made the chi tea, Ms. Schatzman says it was good,\" Christy McKinley, a second year student, announced recently, after hanging up with the teacher.\nThe shop is called the Dixie PIT, which stands for Power in Transition. Although some of the students are not disabled, many are, and the PIT helps them prepare for life after high school.\nThey learn not only how to run a coffee shop but also how to deal with their affairs. They keep a timecard and receive paychecks, which they keep in check registers.\nSpecial-education teachers Kim Chevalier and Sue Casey introduced the Dixie PIT from a similar  program at Kennesaw Mountain High School in Georgia.\nNot that it was easy. Chevalier's first problem to overcome was product-related. Should schools be selling coffee? What about sugar content?\nKenton County Food Service Director Ginger Gray helped. She made sure all the drinks, which use non-fat milk, fell within nutrition   guidelines.\nThe whole school has joined in to help.\nTeachers agreed to give up their l ounge   in the mornings. Art students painted the name of the shop on the wall. Business students designed the paychecks. The basketball team helped pay for cups.",

            "article": "Take That Tiger Mom\nIn the ongoing battle between Tiger Moms, French Mamas, and everyone else who wants to know what is the best way to raise their kids, a new study adds evidence that the extreme Tiger-style may do more harm than good.\nAuthoritarian parents are more likely to end up with disrespectful children with violent behaviors, the study found, compared to parents who listen to their kids with the goal of gaining trust.\nIt was the first study to look at how parenting styles affect the way teens view their parents and, in turn, how they behave.\nThe study considered three general styles of parenting. Authoritative parents are demanding and controlling while also being warm and sensitive to their children's needs.\nAuthoritarian parents, on the contrary, are demanding and controlling without the appearance of caring, attachment and receptiveness. They take a \"my way or the highway\" approach to their kids.\nPermissive parents, the third group, have warm and receptive qualities, but they set few boundaries and carry out few rules.\nUsing data on early 600 kids from an ongoing study of middle school and high school students in New Hampshire, researchers from the University of New Hampshire were able to find \"my way or the highway\" parenting with more violent behaviors like robbery, drug-taking, and attacking someone else with the intention of hurting or killing.\nFirm but loving parenting, on the other hand, led to fewer lawbreakers. Permissive parenting, surprisingly, didn't seem to make much of a difference either.\nTo explain the link between parenting style and behavior in kids, the researchers suggested that what matters most is how reasonable kids think their parents' power is. This sense comes when kids trust that their parents are making the best decisions for them and believe that they need to do what their parents say even if they don't always like how their parents are treating them.\nWhen kids respect the power of their parents, the researchers reported in the journal of Adolescence, their behavior is better. Previous research has also linked firm but caring parenting with kids who have more self-control and independence.\n\"When children consider their parents to be the reliable figure, they trust the parents and feel that they have a duty to do what their parents tell them to do,\" said lead researcher Pick Trinkner. \"This is very important as the parent doesn't have to rely on a system of rewards and punishments to control behavior and the child is more likely to follow the rules when the parent is not physically present.\"",

In this way they are more useful to us than any birds. They clean up the dirty things in our streets. Crows are always hungry. They look for food all day long, and in the evening you can see them in large numbers flying back to their nests  in the trees. They sleep there at night.\nCrows are much noisier than other birds. Very often a large number of crows will get together on one house and talk. Sometimes they talk together, and sometimes they do it by turns like human beings . It is easy to tell from  crows' sounds whether they are pleased or angry. Perhaps crows talk a lot because they are friendly birds. A pair of crows will live together all their lives, and if one of them dies, the other one becomes very sad and quiet for the rest of its life and sometimes it dies, too.",

You are considered lucky if you live in a country where you can drink water out of your kitchen tap or bathroom tap. People in some countries have to pay for drinking water at home. So clean water is one of our most valuabe natural resources .\nIn fact, peole waste so much clean water today. In factories lots of water is wasted. At home many people are not taking showers but still baths, and many are brushing their teeth with the tap turned on. Children are no longer taught how to save water....\nYou can save clean water in many ways. For example, if you keep gold fish, the tank water excellent for graden plants. And when you wash a milk bottle, pour the water on your house plants. Putting a brick or a water into your toilet tank many help use less water, saving many gallons over a long time.\nUsing rainwater is another simple way to save clean water. You can use rainwater to wash your hands after gardening, _ the toilet, and wash your car, your pet, your driveway when they are dirty.\nFor the same reason, people in Malaysia are encourageed to use rainwater. If one has a house with a small garden, he would buy a huge plastic tank to keep rainwater for their daily life.",

After several years, however, the boss promoted Bobby to the position of manager but John remained an ordinary employee . John could not take it any more, so he sent his resignation  and complained that the boss did not value hard working workers but only promoted those who said good words of him.\nThe boss knew that John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, \"Thank you for telling me, but I have a request. I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave. Perhaps you will change your mind and take back your resignation.\"\nJohn agreed. The boss asked him to go and find out anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found out a man selling watermelons. The boss asked how much per kg, John shook his head and went back to the market to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kg.\nThe boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. Bobby went, returned and said only one person sold watermelons. $1.2 for a kg, $10 for 10kg and his watermelons added up to 340. On the table 58 melons, every melon weighs about 2 kg, bought from the south two days ago and they were fresh, red and good quality.\nJohn was surprised and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to go away but to learn from Bobby.\nThe story tells us that a more successful person is more concerned and thinks more. Chances are there in the daily details. For the same thing, a person sees one year ahead, while another sees only tomorrow. The difference between a year and a day is 365 times, how could you win?",

Yet many people do not seem to know that memory works in the same way.\nWhen someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by using it. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong.\nIf a friend says that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault. But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents may be blamed , and few of us know that it is just his own fault. Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but usually they have better memories ? This is because they cannot read or write and they have to remember things, they cannot write them down in a small notebook. They have to remember days, names, songs and stories, so their memory is the whole time being exercised.\nSo if you want to have a good memory, learn from the people: practise remembering things in a way as other people do.",

Actually, it may be confirmed as a very crowded place by new computer models developed to help identify habitable planets.\nEstimates of places where life can exist have been based on the possibility of them having surface water. But software recently developed by the Aberdeen University allows researchers to identify planets with underground water kept liquid by heat from planets.\nWater is fundamental for life and planets too close to the sun lose water to the atmosphere through evaporation. On the other hand, planets located in distant reaches from their star have their surface water locked away as ice.\nSean McMahon, who is carrying out the work, explained: \"Traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone--not too hot and not too cold--then it can have liquid water on its surface and be habitable.\"\nBut this concept might change when considering that planets can receive two sources of heat--heat direct from the star and heat generated deep inside the planet.\nIt is easy to observe it in our own planet. As you go down through the crust   of the Earth, the temperature gets higher and higher. Even when the surface is frozen, water can exist below ground.\nThere could be immense quantities of water in fact--full of primitive life.\nProfessor John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University said: \"There is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, extending down several kilometres\".\n\"And some believe that the majority of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.\"\nSo the Aberdeen team are developing models to predict which distant planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water with the possibility of alien life.",

            "article": "We experience different forms of the Sun's energy every day. We can see its light and feel its warmth. The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. It causes the evaporation   of water from the oceans and lakes. Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food. These green plants then provide food for all organisms  on the Earth.\nMuch of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth's surface. It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere. Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere,30% is reflected by clouds or the Earth's surface. The remaining 70% warms the surface of the planet, causes water to evaporate, and provides energy for the water cycle and weather. Only a tiny part, approximately 0.023%, is actually used by green plants to produce food.\nMany gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth's surface back to the Earth. These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving. They are therefore called greenhouse gases.\nWhen sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface. For example, you've probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it. Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun, so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter. Dark-coloured surfaces, such as dark soil or forest, absorb more energy and help warm the surrounding air.",
